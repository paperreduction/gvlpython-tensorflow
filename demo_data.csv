1,milestones,1,"How are we? Doing well? If you have your Bibles, go ahead and grab them. We’re going to be in Deuteronomy, chapter 6. This has been the text we’ve been in for a month now as we’ve talked about Family Discipleship. What we see in Deuteronomy, chapter 6, is what the Jews would have called the Shema. It was how they understood God growing hearts toward himself. We saw in week one these three concentric circles. We’ve said all along that if you are a parent, you are making disciples. You don’t get to go, “Well, you know, I’m a parent, but I’m not really going to make a disciple.” You are discipling them. You see this all the time. Anytime you see a 4-year-old run up and say something absurd like, “Hook ’em,” you know their parents are discipling them. Or “Gig ’em” or “Sic ’em” or “Boomer” or whatever. What happens in that moment is you have discipled your children. “We don’t do that in this house. We do this. We cheer for them. We want them to lose every week.” You’re making a disciple. Every time your child does something you do and you see that, you’ve made a disciple. When they talk like you… Every parent has that moment of crisis where our kid just acted like us, and we went, “Oh no. They’re literally doing what I do, not what I say.” That’s making disciples. If you have a kid, you are a disciple-maker. The question, the argument, is not…Are you making disciples? Rather, what are you discipling them toward? That’s always the question, because as a parent, you are discipling your children. You’re shaping how they see the world. You’re shaping how they interact with that world. You have created for them touchdowns that are success and failures that are marked. You have done that. You have said, “This is the win in our family. This is the loss.” You do that. Whether you know you’re doing it or not, you have said to your children, “This is what’s important. This is what’s not important. We’re going to orient our lives around this, and we’re not going to orient our lives around this.” You have done that. Right now, if you’re a parent, regardless of how old your kid is, you are doing just that. You’re saying to your family, “This is what we value, and this is what we do not value.” The Shema is actually quoted by Jesus in the New Testament when a group of men ask him, “What’s the greatest commandment? What does it really mean to follow the Lord?” He quotes the Shema. “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself. The second commandment is like the first.” They’re tied together. The Shema is deep with meaning. We said in week one… We looked at these concentric circles of how disciples of Jesus are made. Let’s look at this again together. Deuteronomy, chapter 6, starting in verse 4. Here’s what we’re looking for. Concentric circles of how our hearts grow and overflow out of themselves to make disciples. “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart.” There’s circle number one. Circle number one is just what it means to be a Christian. This is a stunning pronouncement of how and what it looks like to follow God. I said in week one… I can’t rehash the entire series, but I do want to say to you over and over and over again that you are not primarily a thinking being. What I mean by that is your life is not marked by what you think is right and wrong. Your life is marked by what you love. We are primarily lovers and worshipers. You can say with your mouth all you want about what you value and what you treasure and what you stand for, but when all is said and done, you are a person driven by your loves. This is universally true. This is why Jesus says, “Where your treasure is, there’s your heart.” Do you want to know what you really value and what you really love? Look at what you spend your money on. Forget the rhetoric. It’s our hearts and our loves that drive us. That’s why Jesus’ command here, the command of God coming down to the people of God, is not, “Do these things, and don’t do these things,” but rather, “Work on growing a love relationship with me, because if you love me with all your heart, all your soul, all your might, then all of the rest of that takes care of itself.” What the Christian does is give themselves over to the filling of their lives with things that stir their affections for Jesus. That’s a sweet gig. What stirs up my heart for Jesus? What is it? I know the Bible is going to be involved. I know prayer is going to be involved, but what else is it? Is it early mornings? Is it late nights? Is it this type of scenery? Is it this kind of book? What is it that stirs my affections for Jesus, and what is it that robs me of that affection? Then I’m just going to jam my life full. There’s nothing awful about that at all. What really stirs up my heart toward happiness in Christ? Fill my life with that. Nobody is like, “Oh gosh, that sounds like such a drag.” No, no, no. This is building ourselves up in love. If we have any shot of discipling our children in what ultimately will matter, it starts with us being serious about a growing love relationship with God. We’re in different spaces in that. Some of us just have a little inkling of love. Others of us are further down the line and are aflame, but the call on your life and my life as a mom and dad, in fact as a Christian, is to have our affections stirred toward Jesus Christ. That leads us into the second circle. Verse 7: “You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.” That’s circle two. That’s your children, your home, this place where as you do life, you’re talking about the things of the Lord. You’re teaching them a love for the Lord. You can’t make them love the Lord, but you are modeling for them what it looks like to love the Lord. You’re not just churchgoers, but your home is shaped by this God you say you love. Verse 9 is the third circle. We haven’t talked much about the third circle. We’re not going to today, but verse 9 is, “You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.” This is that outward-focused missional living, where the world sees that we value and treasure Christ in a way that’s compelling. It’s on our doorposts. It’s on our gates. People know we’re weirdo religious people. They know we love the Lord and we’re serious about him. We’re not just churchgoers, but we’ve been transformed by something. We’re odd, “aliens and strangers,” as the Bible would call us. Then we set out to say when we’re talking about family discipleship and these concentric circles, we’re talking about time, moments, and milestones. We defined time like this. All these are going to come together in today’s talk. In time, we talked about creating intentional time built into the rhythm of the family’s life for the purpose of thinking about, talking about, and living out the gospel. There were four C’s when we talked about time. I was really proud of myself on coming up with four C’s. We talked about consistency. Don’t lose heart, parents. We’re not talking about consistency like, “Every Monday night at 7:00 we’re having a family devotional.” That’s not always going to happen, and you’re going to lose heart because you’re not consistent. What we mean by consistency is it’s not a one-time conversation where we check the box. We don’t have one spiritual conversation with our children and then go, “Okay, I did that. We’ll see what they decide.” It’s a consistent… We keep bringing it up. We keep having the conversation. The second thing we talked about on this is clarity. It’s important that our kids understand what we’re saying, so we ask open-ended questions. We ask them to repeat back to us what they thought they heard as we consistently have these conversations. Then we talked about creativity. I used that great G.K. Chesterton quote about the gladness of the heart of God and how childlike God is because he does not sin. I really wanted to force the issue. If every time you talk about spiritual matters with your children you furrow your brow and get crusty, that’s not helpful. If you’re always like, “You straighten up! God loves you, and he loves all of us,” that’s just not helpful. The God of the Bible, according to the Bible, sings, laughs, dances, delights. He plays. I’m not saying there isn’t a space in which kids should be serious. I’m saying there’s a kind of seriousness that brings joy. Parents should lead the way in the joy of the Lord. Then we finally talked about counsel. What we said on counsel when we talked about time is that we want to make you look like all-stars, Mom and Dad, so we’re going to do everything we can to set you up for the win. If you have a first through fifth grader who’s in class, when you go pick them up today, we’ve got you again. Sheet is waiting. It’s waiting right on the door. You’ll pick up your kid. This is in the door. You take it, and here’s what we have. We have your conversation. You’re not adding anything to your schedule. You’re going to get in the car and go somewhere after this. I know that. You’re going to get in your car, and you’re going to drive somewhere. So we have four questions for you. We’ve clearly set you up this week, even more so than other weeks. Today they’ve learned that Jesus alone brings sinners to God. Here’s your question: “Today you learned about someone being the way, the truth, and the life. Who was that?” Jesus. Second question: “What does it mean for Jesus to be the way? How does following him lead us to God?” You have a 90-percent chance right there of hearing, “I don’t know. I don’t remember.” Okay, but listen. The win isn’t that they have the right answer; the win is that in asking them the question you’re showing them a priority and a value of your family life that communicates to them that they’re not just churchgoers but that this Jesus is going to permeate your lives. Then all you need is to find 15 minutes in your calendar this week, and we have your family devotional. We have it for you spelled out, parents, even the activity for this week. When we’re talking about counsel, we’re saying we want to set you up to be “Mom and Dad of the Year.” That’s available for you every week. Then the next week we talked about moments. Moments are about capturing and leveraging opportunities in the course of everyday life (again, this is what we’re already doing) for the purpose of gospel-centered conversation. If we’re going to turn little moments of everyday life into conversations about the gospel, there were three things I said we were going to need. We’re going to need to be observant. We’re going to have to pay attention to the kids we have, how they’re wired. We’re going to need to look for those opportunities. We’re going to be prepared, and we need to know two things on being prepared. We need to know something of the nature and character of God, and we need to know something in regard to godly character. If you’re like, “I’m no theologian,” again, we’ve got you. You don’t have to be. You just have to be able to read pages 22 and 23. You might be like, “That’s a huge book.” I’m saying, “Fine. Two pages…22 and 23.” Now you have something of the nature and character of God and something about godly character that you can seize these moments and turn the conversation to who God is and what God wants for us for our joy and his glory over and over and over again. Lastly, we talked about being genuine. When we talked about being genuine, we talked about the fact that, ultimately, what we want our kids to know is that we don’t want to manipulate them with the Bible or try to control them with religion, but we want there to never be a doubt that we love them and we’re for them. We want to love the kid we have, not the one we want. Some of our kids are optimists, and everything is always awesome. They’re kind of Tigger. Then some of our kids are like Eeyore. “I knew it was going to rain today.” They’re more like Eeyore. You don’t ask Eeyore to be Tigger, and you don’t ask Tigger to be Eeyore. You love the kid you have, not the one you want. You engage them where they are. You’re genuine. You love them. They might not agree with you, but there shouldn’t be any doubt in their minds that you see them and that you love them. This is what we mean by genuine. We’ll end our series today by talking about milestones. Milestones are marking and making occasions to celebrate and commemorate significant spiritual milestones of God’s work in the life of the family and the child. Here’s a good way to think about it: marking and making, celebrating and commemorating. That’s what we’re doing. Now these all start to flow together. As we’re spending this intentional time being consistent with these conversations, seeking clarity, having fun, using the tools that are available to us, and as we’re seizing these moments, as we observed, with how we’ve prepared, now we begin in these moments to mark pretty big ones and then begin to make some other ones. Then we celebrate and commemorate these things. Let’s just talk about marking and making. First, let’s talk about marking. God has wired us to be people who remember. I think this will be a universal experience for everyone in the room. If you ever go out with a group of your friends or a group of family members… Maybe it’s just four of you. Maybe it’s six of you. Maybe it’s ten of you. If you go out, every single time you get together, at some point, regardless of what the point of the evening is, it will devolve into storytelling. As soon as somebody starts to tell the story, then you can just see other people go, “Uh-huh,” just waiting for them to finish so they can throw their story out there. Then it just becomes, “Hey, remember that time,” or “Hey, one time I was…” We are a storytelling people, and this is universally true everywhere in the world. By the grace of God, I’ve been multiple places in Africa, in India, in China, in Europe, in Australia, in South Africa. Everywhere I go, people at dinner tell stories. They remember. They laugh. They cry. Most of the stories are crazily embellished. They’re different every time it’s told. You’re like, “Wait a minute. I thought last time it was two touchdowns that game.” “Well, no, there was a pick six.” “Oh yeah, you just for seven years have never mentioned that, and then tonight, apparently, the pick six enters the story.” You become a better athlete as you get older, not worse. Right? The older you get, the better you were. This is what happens. We’re a storytelling people. We remember. Yet one of the evidences that not all is well in our hearts is what we choose to forget. Namely, when it comes to God, the people of God throughout the Scriptures and throughout history are very quick to forget how good God has been to them historically. God will deliver. He will save. He will make a way. He will invade dark spaces and drag into the light. He will show up and support and build up and enable and empower us to hang in there, if not outright flourish and conquer. Then what’ll happen is we’ll hit another storm. We’ll hit another low point, and then all of a sudden we feel like God has abandoned us and betrayed us, and we just knew he would eventually do this because we don’t have a consistent quiet time. That’s where we go. We go to the dark places. We’re prone to forget the goodness of God. When we’re talking about marking, we’re talking about remembering and building things into our lives that enable us to remember. Let me show you one place this happens biblically, although I could be at length with this. Just so you know, I am swimming in the book of Exodus right now, because I’ll start to preach it in the fall. We’ll start mid-August, and we’ll go through, I think, next June in the book of Exodus. So just be prepared that for the rest of the summer, every subtext I use…not the anchor text, but the subtext…will probably be out of the book of Exodus. Exodus, chapter 12, starting in verse 24, says this. This is right after the Passover. “’You shall observe this rite [the Passover meal] as a statute for you and for your sons forever. And when you come to the land that the Lord will give you, as he has promised, you shall keep this service. And when your children say to you, ”What do you mean by this service?“ you shall say, ”It is the sacrifice of the Lord’s Passover, for he passed over the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians but spared our houses.“’ And the people bowed their heads and worshiped.” Then later on, when the people of Israel cross the Jordan River and get to the other side…now they’re in the Promised Land…God commands a man from each of the 12 tribes to grab a stone and build an altar on the other side of the Jordan River. Why? As an act of remembrance. It’s very familiar language when they build that altar, so that they might look and remember what God accomplished in their day. God, longing to anchor us to himself, anchor us in his goodness and grace, to fortify us in the day of trouble as we live in this space in between what Christ has purchased for us in its ultimate fulfillment in the return of Christ or our death, we remember. We’re anchored in the truth of God’s goodness in our lives by building milestones that enable us to remember. This is what marking is all about. For our kids, we’re looking for those moments that are probably more significant moments than the smaller moments. Let me give some examples. When your child is baptized. That’s a pretty big milestone. We want to commemorate that and celebrate that. Your kid’s first Bible, their first Communion. Those kinds of things. Those kinds of spiritual highlights. We want to mark those things. We want to commemorate them. We want to wire some things into our lives so we’ll never forget all that God did to get them to that point. We want to figure out a way to celebrate that. It doesn’t have to be complex. It can be taking them out to dinner. It can be buying them a gift. It can be a trip. I’m not talking about Paris. If you have that kind of flow, take them to Paris. Most of us don’t. “You know what? I’m glad you were baptized. I’m going to take you to Paris.” That’s not most of our world. If that’s you, get on your jet and go, boss. I’m just saying you don’t really need to do that. It can be driving down into Dallas. It could be taking them to a park, getting one-on-one time with them. My favorite is just a handwritten letter. Brothers, sisters, a handwritten letter to your children that marks special occasions will be a stunning gift to them the rest of their lives. Long after Daddy and Mommy are gone, a 40- or 50-year-old son or daughter can pull a letter and remember, not through pictures but through your very words, what they meant, what you loved about them, how you cared for them, and your hopes for them. How easy is a handwritten letter? You don’t have to be a poet. Golly! In the world we live in, you don’t even have to be able to spell. The computer will spell it for you. You can have your pen, and then just type it in and go, “Oh gosh, nope. Autocorrect. Okay, that’s how you spell that word. Love.” You can do that. These are ways we mark, we commemorate. Our oldest, Audrey, turned 13 this year. One of the things Lauren wanted us to do as we thought about our children, thought about how we wanted to parent… For Lauren and me, there was never this point that anybody said to me, “Okay, now you’re a man.” No one ever did that. No one ever said, “Okay, now you’re a man.” You just kind of wake up one day, and you’re like, “Oh gosh, I’m a man.” You’re in a weird meeting you can kind of remember your dad having. You’re sitting with a life insurance person, and you’re like, “What? Why am I… Oh my gosh! I’m a man. I’m buying life insurance for myself. When did that happen?” I have a mortgage. That’s freaking me out a little bit. There was never anything in my life that during transitional periods of my life someone was there to say, “You’re doing great. This is stage two. This is where we’re headed. Come on, you can do it.” So we wanted to create those things for our children. When Audrey turned 13 in February, we had a rite of passage party for her. If that sounds really geeky and lame, it is geeky; it wasn’t lame. What Lauren and I did is we sat down and came up with 12 attributes Audrey has shown, part of who she is, from when she was in diapers. Audrey is witty. That’s a better way to say sarcastic or smart-mouthed. She’s quick-witted. She is compassionate. She is crazy courageous. In fact, she’s the only human being ever I have been like, “God, can you sow some fear into her heart, please?” I mean, broken collarbone. Been bucked off her horse. Been rolled over on top of by her horse, only to get back up, smack it, and climb back on. I mean, just no fear in that girl at all. Then we invited some women who really have poured into her, who love her, who she loves. We brought a couple in from out of town, and then many of them are actually here. The only men who were in the room were my dad, my father-in-law, Lauren’s brother, and me. Those were the only men in the room, and then there were these women, and then three of her little friends. What we did is we brought her cake in, and there were the 13 candles. People would read that attribute. Courageous. They would tell a story and encourage her heart. “We love the courage God has put in you. We think the Lord is going to use that courage in stunning ways. Be careful that your courage might lead you to this, when what the Lord wants to do is this. We wanted to affirm it, call it out, and bless it.” They would read that, and I threatened them. “You’re going to need to stay about three minutes. Somebody gets verbal diarrhea here I’ll shut it down. I ain’t scared to go, ’All right, thank you. That was awesome. Courageous. Great. Next!’” So they would read that, light the candle, and then they went around the room. After everybody had gone, the 12 attributes had gone, I had written a letter to Audrey where I just blessed her, and then I talked about the space we were entering. “At 13, you’re moving more quickly toward womanhood, but you’re still somewhat tethered to childhood. In that, there’s this pressure and pull in two separate directions. You’re going to want more freedom. You’re going to want more space. You’re going to feel the pull of being who God designed you to be, and yet you’re still a little bit tethered to childhood. This is going to create tension in you and conflict with us.” This is universally true. Nobody is going to escape 13 to 17 without drama. It just doesn’t happen. We just wanted to acknowledge, “This is coming.” “Here’s what we want to lay before you. Because you’re now 13, we will increase your responsibilities, and if you walk into these responsibilities you will get increased freedom. If you do not walk into these increased responsibilities you will not get more freedom. In a very real way, 13-year-old Audrey, we are laying before you the opportunity to grow this direction and be supported in this tethering.” I outlined exactly what those responsibilities would be and what kind of freedoms she could gain. Then there was an exchanging of vows, where everyone in the room committed verbally to Audrey that we were going to encourage her, pray for her, and, when necessary, lovingly confront her for her good and the glory of God. Then we just laid before her the opportunity to walk into that and said, “If you want to take this next step, you light the thirteenth candle.” She came and lit the thirteenth candle. We prayed over her. We got all those little notes and books and made a little thing for her and gave it to her so she could keep it and go back and read those things we wrote for her. For the rest of her life, I think Audrey will look back on her thirteenth birthday and remember that night. She didn’t get any exotic gifts or anything like that. It was just, “At 13 we said to you, ’You’ve taken a step toward all God has for you in being a woman, and here’s what that’s going to look like.’” It’s clear communication and celebration, and it was an epic night. That’s what we mean by milestones: setting a marker down in a way that the mind is informed and the heart is stirred up. That moves us to making. When we talk about making, here’s what we’re talking about. Marking is looking back; making is looking ahead. Again, this idea of kids need something to aim for. They just need something to aim for. They need to know what’s next. What’s the next step? How should I be growing? Again, I think this is stuff you’re already doing. Every time you say to your son, “Hold the door for your sisters,” you’re doing a making. You’re saying, “This is what men do.” Every time you say to your girls something, you’re teaching them, “This is what a woman does.” You’re giving them something to strive for, something to grow into, and something to move toward. These are good right things. Al Mohler, who is president of Southern Seminary and a leading intellect in our day… I don’t know if you know that, but intellect is actually a job. I tried to argue with one once that it wasn’t, but he was an intellect, so I lost. Al Mohler said in 1960 the vast majority of young adults had, by the time they reached 30, accomplished the five standard milestones used to measure adult status. These five milestones are sociological, not theological, although the Bible has much to say about all five of these. These milestones include completing school, leaving home, getting married, having a child, and establishing financial independence. According to the US Census Bureau, less than one half of all young women reached these milestones by age 30 in 2000. Even more concerning, less than one third of all young men did. What we’re seeing in our culture is an ever-expanding time period of adolescence, so that you literally have 28-year-old boys and 30-year-old girls, and that shouldn’t be. Let me just say this about the five standards. There are, at times, forces outside of our control surrounding all of these. So you need to listen to that quote and go, “Well, I might live at home, but man, medically this happened or financially this happened or this situation.” It’s not trying to judge you. It’s just sociologically, here’s how we’ve judged human flourishing in this culture as far back as we go. This is not a problem with children; it’s a problem with parents. Parents have not said, “This is what it means to grow up, and we’re going to, in a strong relationship with you, move you toward adulthood.” We have said, “You make us matter. You give us purpose. You give us value, so stay as long as you can, and we’re going to take care of anything that causes you pain. We’re not going to make you fight your own fights. We’re not going to make you own your own sin. We’re not going to make you own your own mistakes. We’re going to clean it up for you, and we’re going to make your life a life of ease.” What you get is a 30-year-old boy playing Call of Duty on your couch, unwilling to commit to anything, unwilling to grow into what God has called for him. I’m telling you, the broken, incestuous relationship that is is you somehow get value from that that you should not be getting. Your role as Mom and Dad is to lay out some making, some pictures of what life is supposed to be, and in a strong relationship, move them in that direction. The fact that we make our kids make their beds isn’t because if they don’t make their beds the house explodes. The reason we’re serious about their schoolwork is not because I think if they make all A’s they’re going to have better lives. I don’t believe that. I don’t think that’s true. I certainly haven’t seen that that’s true. But hard work and discipline will be required regardless of where they go or what they’re called to, and so we’re making. “Here’s what you do.” As they get older, that responsibility increases, because they’re growing closer and closer and closer to adulthood. My job is to get them to adulthood. That’s my job. Not to get my value and to go, “Aren’t they awesome and aren’t I awesome because they’re awesome?” That’s not what this is. This is not a competition sport for parents. We love them. We encourage them. We walk with them. We shape them. We require of them…lovingly, honestly, openly require of them. We hold firm standards for them, loving them as they fail, understanding the grace of God on their lives, like we understand it on ours, speaking life to them. We want touchdowns for them. “Here’s how you win. Here’s how we expect, and here’s what we’re going to celebrate and rejoice in when you do it.” Then we want to drop stakes in the ground. Here’s where they start to be related. If you have older kids, when you mark for that kid, you’re making for your others. If I go back to Audrey’s birthday, little brother and little sister were in the room. What they heard us say is, “Here’s what you get when you’re 13. You get increased responsibilities. If all your homework is done and your reading is done, then you get to stay up till 9:00. You don’t have to go to bed at 8:00.” So now they’re going, “Okay, I’d like that.” “Okay, well, here’s what that requires.” “Okay, I’ll move toward that.” “Well, move toward it when you’re 13.” Boom! You got it. In one sense, you’re marking while you’re creating a touchdown for your younger kids. So now there’s not this kind of, “What are we going to do?” They’re really geeked up about their thirteenth birthdays now, because for us, we decided 13 was going to be that age that we dropped a stake in the ground for them. Then we’re going to do it again probably at 17 or 18, and then we’ll see after that. We haven’t thought that far ahead, to be honest with you. We have 13 down, which is good, because we have a 13-year-old. So marking and making then can begin to walk side by side. Another game we’ve played with our kids… For the last 20 years, I have traveled more than I should, and by the grace of God, come this fall, I am here and at home, and most of my traveling will stop. That has been a two-year process of trying to stop the crazy pace we’ve been living on. What we told our kids is if they could sit through a service at The Village without having to get up and go to the bathroom and without having to be told to be quiet and quit squirming, they could travel with Daddy. We’ve tested them. They get a once-a-month shot until they make it, and that’s it. So my kids will have to come in and sit on a weekend Lauren is not singing, and they can’t go to the bathroom, and they can’t be told even once to be quiet, and they have to take notes, and when Dad gets home, they have to give Dad his outline. If they can do that, they can travel with Daddy. You can giggle about that, but if I’m at a conference in an arena and I’m preaching my message and all of a sudden think, “Where did Audrey go?” that’s a problem. So they have to do that. We’ve been ruthless. I just remember Reid was like, “Ooh,” and then he just bailed with like two minutes left in the service. We were like, “Good try. Try again next month.” Just not giving an inch on that. That sets a touchdown for them. “If you can sit through an hour-and-20-ish-minute service, then you can travel with Daddy.” At this point, I have had a blast. Audrey has been to London and San Diego and China and Uganda. It has been awesome taking them with me. Reid has been all over. I was doing these men conferences called Act Like Men for a while, and little buddy went to every one of those things with me. Now Norah still hasn’t quite made it. She failed two weeks ago, so she has another two weeks to give it another go. She has to hurry, because Daddy is about to get off the road. Got to hurry up and get that trip in. We’ll see. That’s an example of just saying, “We want to create touchdowns for you. We want to create opportunities for you to grow and win.” When we talk about counsel, we talk about how The Village wants to serve you to this end. We’ve created some of these milestones for you. Let me give you some examples. Again, parents, you can do this. You can do it. The first is we’ve created a baby dedication kit for you. I’ll tell you why we did it that way. It was my experience, and maybe my experience shouldn’t be the gauge by which we gauged it, but it was my experience and others that baby dedications in the churches we got saved in was much more a fashion show for the kid than it was any type of real baby dedication. So we wanted to create a kit that you, as parents, could take and invite family members and friends and those who are going to be a part of this kid’s life and can put on a formal baby dedication for that child with your family members and friends, where there are prayers and promises and vows and a certificate and all of that just set up for you, so you can drop a stake in the ground and say, “We’re going to raise this child in the fear of the Lord, and we want our friends to hold us accountable to that.” That’s just there for you. You can pick it up any given weekend. We wanted to provide that for you. Parents, I would pay particular attention to Promotion Sundays, particularly kindergarten to first, because that’s when they leave Little Village and roll into Kids Village; and then fifth to sixth, because that’s when they leave Kids’ Village, our elementary school ministry, and roll into junior high; and then eighth to ninth, because that’s when they roll into high school. Again, this isn’t complex. Moms and dads, this is simply on Promotion Sunday, you’re going to take them to lunch, and you just talk about what you saw and loved about the elementary school years. You remember. You do what you do. You tell a couple of funny stories. “Love this about you. Excited for you as we’re moving into… Are you anxious about it? What are you nervous about? I’m not nervous. Maybe I am, but I’m not telling you I’m nervous. You’re going to do so well. You’re going to have great opportunities. There are some dangers, but Mom and Dad are here.” It’s just conversation over lunch. Grandparents, get in that game. We need you. Then other examples. Baptism. We have a Family Baptism Class, where you can sit in the room with your child and hear about baptism. There are some questions we ask you and you get to ask them. It’s this really cool milestone moment that baptism is, and we want to come alongside of you and help you. One of my favorites that we have done every summer for the last four or five years, because we know it’s here… We have live on our website right now the summer activity guide for families. So right now, if you went and gave money to Lewisville and you registered to serve on July 30 and then you downloaded this book, we’ve got you. You don’t need to read this book. You can just use this book. As summer is coming along, if you’re going on vacation, table of contents: vacation. If you’re flying, we’ve got you. If you’re driving, we’ve got you. How to turn that aspect of vacation into conversations about the Lord, dropping a stake in the ground. We have fun family activities for you; hence, Summer Family Activity Book. Going on hikes. Going on walks. Watching a movie outside. All sorts of things. We just want to give it to you so you can drop stakes in the ground with your children. If you have middle school and high school students, what we do every two years is a series on sex and sexuality followed by a Commitment Service. The next one will be May of 2017. We’re doing that every two years with our students. Then lastly, when your child turns 16, they are now eligible (eligible is a strange word, but I don’t know another word to use there) to become covenant members of the church. The reason we like 16 is they’re able at 16 to serve the local body in a way that they’re more mindful of and knowledgeable of what they’re doing. So at 16, they can sit through Covenant Membership Class, become covenant members, and then begin to serve the church. That’s a huge deal. That’s a huge milestone to celebrate, that they belong to the local body in a way where they’re working out the “one anothers” in a given local context. That’s a great opportunity. So these are ways we’re just trying to set you up to win, Mom and Dad. Josh Patterson, who’s one of the lead pastors (we have three lead pastors here) and an elder, does this great talk on the philosophy of ministry for The Village Church. If you’ve been in our membership class, you’ve heard it. If you haven’t, you probably haven’t, but eventually I’ll have him do it on a weekend. We looked at the landscape of where we were. There are multiple ways to do family discipleship. There’s not a wrong way. You have to choose the way you want to do it. Josh’s illustration is if you watch football, there’s the 4-3 defense and the 3-4 defense. It’s not right or wrong. It’s you have to pick one to run. If you try to run both, you’re going to have the wrong personnel and you’re probably going to get scored on a lot. You have to pick your defense. You have to hire according to that scheme, and then you have to execute correctly. There are two ways to do family discipleship. One is a highly programmatic approach. What that means is that the church would hire staff and build out robust programs, where you drop your kid off and we teach them the Bible, and then you drop your kid off and we teach them how to sing songs, and then you drop your kid off and we teach them how to pray, and then you drop your kid off and we teach them about global missions, and then you drop your kid off and we… Right? There’s nothing wrong with that. There are churches right by God, pleasing to the Lord, doing that all around us. We think it’s awesome, yet at the end of the day, they’re going home with you, and regardless of what we build in regard to programming, we will never have the influence you will in your time with them. So what our philosophy of ministry is on family discipleship is we have things for them to come to and to learn about and to teach them, but what we want to do more and more and more is just put everything in your hands and be your biggest fans. We want to say, “Mom and Dad, you can do this. Mom and Dad, you’re going to crush this. Here, all you have to do is read these sentences on the way home. All you have to do is find…” Again, I’ll say we’re a month into this. Fifteen minutes a week makes you “Mom and Dad of the Year.” I don’t care what you do in here; you have 15 minutes. Fifteen minutes to look at the calendar, to intentionally think about how you want to apply, and then to execute. It’s going to be imperfect. It’s going to be messy. Americans want things fast, big, and famous, but that’s not how discipleship works. Discipleship is slow. It’s inefficient. It’s a moment at a time for a lifetime. Moms and dads, you can do this. If you’re here and you’re like, “Oh my gosh! I don’t even know where to start,” no, you know exactly where to start. We’ll be done in 10 minutes, and you’re going to just pick this up. You’re going to say, “Hey, today you learned about someone being the way, the truth, and the life. Who could that be?” You might even get, “I don’t know.” Jesus. “Was it Jesus, buddy?” “Yeah.” “Well, how is he the way? How does he get us to God?” “I don’t know.” “Man, I don’t either, but you know what? We’re going to find out together.” Here’s something I want by the grace of God to knock out of your head. For whatever reason, in our minds we think success is walking up to one of our kids and going, “Hey, I just noticed you seem a little bit agitated lately. You seem like something is off. Are you okay? Is everything all right in your world?” The only way that can possibly be successful is if then in that moment they start to cry and go, “You know what? No. I’ve just really been struggling. Will you teach me what to do? Will you lead me?” I’m telling you, Mom and Dad, stop that. The win is the question itself. The win says, “I see you. I care about you. I’m here for you.” Gosh, they might not know what’s going on in their own hearts. Think of how often you don’t know what’s going on in yours. The win is not them being able to verbally vomit all over you what’s going on. Occasionally that will happen, and that’s an awesome gift from God, but your job, parents, isn’t to extract that from them like they’re prisoners with information you need to have. It’s to let them know you’re here, that you love them and that you see them. It’s, “Are you okay? Is everything going all right? How are things with your friends? How has school been? Everything all right out at the barn? I’ve just noticed.” It’s not, “You’d better tell me what’s going on at the barn. I’ll call her mom. You think I won’t call her mom? You think I won’t call up the school and get to the bottom of this? You’d better tell me what’s…” That’s not saying, “I love you. I care for you.” That’s, “You’re a liar, and I don’t believe you, and I’m going to manage your life for you.” Our job is not to manage their lives. Our job is to love, to lead, to set boundaries, to grow them in responsibilities, and to turn their eyes toward Jesus. Mom and Dad, you can do this. You’re going to crush it. I’m already proud of you, and we haven’t even gotten out of here yet. I thought we would end our series the way we started our series, and that’s by reading out loud together boldly Psalm 145, verses 1-9. We’re going to boldly read this out loud, and we’re going to fill this auditorium and the other auditoriums with the Word of God, talking about the greatness of God and commending the greatness of God to the next generation. Do me a favor. Will you stand as we read this together? I’m going to start, and then I’m going to bail out a little bit, because you tend to read better when I’m not reading with you. So let’s start this together. “I will extol you, my God and King, and bless your name forever and ever. Every day I will bless you and praise your name forever and ever. Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, and his greatness is unsearchable. One generation shall commend your works to another, and shall declare your mighty acts. On the glorious splendor of your majesty, and on your wondrous works, I will meditate. They shall speak of the might of your awesome deeds, and I will declare your greatness. They shall pour forth the fame of your abundant goodness and shall sing aloud of your righteousness. The Lord is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love. The Lord is good to all, and his mercy is over all that he has made.” Amen. Father, we thank you. We bless your name. Would you, in your mercy, encourage our hearts, strengthen our hands? I pray that we might in small ways nurture and cherish the souls you have entrusted to us. It’s for your beautiful name we pray, amen."
2,moments,1,"Hey. How are we? Are you doing all right? Excellent. If you have your Bibles, go ahead and grab those. We’re going to be in Deuteronomy 6. We’ve been in that book for the last couple of weeks. This will make our third week in Deuteronomy 6. Again, I think we want to really dial in and dig in to this text in particular. There’s been quite a bit of conversation in our offices this morning about whether or not my shirt is pink. Here’s the deal. I don’t know, and I don’t care. All right? It’s springtime. It’s a spring color. My wife dresses me. I’m done with it. I don’t want to talk about it anymore, all right? Don’t encourage me. We’ll be here all day if you encourage me. Deuteronomy 6 is what the Jews called the Shema. It was how they saw God educating them and educating their families and, therefore, educating them as a people. Two weeks ago when we started digging into this, we said what we see in the Shema is this grouping of concentric circles that show us or inform us of how our hearts grow in the Lord and then how, ultimately, the hearts of those around us grow in the Lord. We’ve been talking about family discipleship, right? Moms and Dads, we’re already making disciples. I think you already know this if you have kids. Right? You know this the first time your kid says something that you say but you’d just rather not them say. Then they say it, and you’re like, “I’m making disciples.” You didn’t even know you were making disciples, and yet you’re great at making disciples. You know this when your kid does something you don’t want them to do but you do. Right? We’ve talked about how to think rightly about making disciples in our home, making followers of Christ in our home, just being really honest out of the gate that parenting is hard work and nobody does it perfectly. We read the Shema to find these concentric circles, to consider them, and then by the grace of God implement. Let’s look at this together. Deuteronomy 6, starting in verse 4. “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.” This is circle one. “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart.” That’s circle one. You want to know how Christian education works, what it looks like to grow as a disciple and to make disciples? It starts in circle one. Circle one is that you, Mom; you, Dad; you, single; you, married with no children…you love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might. I’ve always pointed out to kind of the stunning reality of where all this begins. He didn’t say, “You’re not behaving well enough, so behave better.” He said, “Love me.” The great command of the Scriptures (and this is a sweet deal) is that you and I get to fill our lives with things that stir our affections for Jesus. That’s what we get to do. That’s what we give ourselves over to on a daily basis. “What can I do today that stirs up my affections for the Creator of the universe, that increases my joy in God?” There should be no begrudging submission to that. “Do I have to?” Increase your joy? Yes. Increase your capacity to love? Yes, you do. You have to give yourself over to that. This isn’t this giant complexity of ever-increasing morality. It’s loving the Lord, and then that stuff handles itself. Circle one into circle two. Verse 7: “You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.” The place in which you live is the second circle, but you can only make disciples of Christ in the second circle if you, yourself, are growing in a love relationship with God in Christ. Then the last verse. Verse 9: “You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.” This would be kind of your outreach or how to show the city or engage our neighbors. That’s the last circle. We won’t even really address that circle in this series because we’re talking about family discipleship. We said we’re going to talk about family discipleship through this lens. We’re going to talk about time, we’re going to talk about moments, and we’re going to talk about milestones. Last week we talked about time. Here’s how we defined time. We said family discipleship time is creating intentional time built into the rhythm of the family’s life. You’re not adding anything. You’re just building this into the rhythm you’re already in. Remember when you sit down, when you rise up, when you go on the way, when you drive in the car, when you’re taking them to practice, when you’re picking them up from school, when you’re putting them to bed, when you’re waking them up. As you do, not add these things. That’s imperative that you understand this as we continue to dive into this series. It’s not, “Add these things.” It’s, “As you’re doing what you’re already doing, be more intentional and mindful.” I said last week as we discussed time that I think you can do everything we’re going to teach in this series in 10 minutes a week. Ten minutes is all it will take. Create an intentional time built into the rhythm of the family’s life for the purpose of… What’s the purpose of this intentional time? Thinking about, talking about, and living out the gospel. We said if we were going to do this, there were four things. I started all of them with C because of my Baptist roots. We said we’re going to need to be consistent. By consistent, I don’t mean that every Monday night we do this. I mean that it’s a conversation we have over and over and over again. If you think about you, if you’re a Christian, if you think about how often you need to be encouraged in the Lord, you need to be reminded of his grace, you need to be stirred anew with what’s true about God and what’s not true that you are telling yourself, how much more often do children need to be reminded of these things? When we’re talking about consistency, we just mean it’s a conversation we keep having. In fact, if your kid has not yet said to you, “Are we always going to talk about this?” you’re probably not having it enough. You don’t want them to hate the conversation. You do want them to know you’re going to be having it often. Then we talked about clarity, right? We need to make sure we’re talking about spiritual things in ways they can hear and understand. If you’re bringing up the Bema Seat or talking about transubstantiation, my guess is your fourth grader probably isn’t following along with you. If you’re introducing Jonathan Edwards to your third grader, I mean, maybe that’s why it’s more than likely it’s not… Unless, you know… I mean, I’ve seen your bumper stickers. Maybe your kid is just a little intellectual genius. Then we talked about being creative. All we meant by being creative is…listen…we serve a God (that’s why I started with the G.K. Chesterton quote) who created laughter and who is joy personified. The older I get, the more I’m skeptical (and color me judgmental) of crusty, angry Christianity. I find them to be irreconcilable. We should be marked by joy as we steep in God’s delight in us despite us. We should be marked not by Spirit-sprinkled, fake happiness but deep-seated, rooted joy in knowing our God is for us and not against us, regardless of life’s circumstances. We talked about being creative, having fun as we make this intentional time and turn to the gospel. Then lastly we said as a church we wanted to serve as counsel. We wanted to set you up to crush it (slang for “do really well at it”). We want to set you up to just excel at this. Here’s what I said last week. I think it’s important. If you have a first through fifth grader and you checked them in, they are learning about Jesus as the Good Shepherd. That’s what they’re learning about right now. They’ve already sung, and now they’re learning about Jesus as the Good Shepherd. Boom! When you pick them up, this is in the doorway. We got you, fam. Here’s what you have. On the car ride home, you don’t even have to say, “Hey, what did you learn about today?” because they will say, “I don’t remember.” We’re not setting you up like that, because we want you to win. You’re going to get to say, “Hey, I heard/read you learned that Jesus was the Good Shepherd. What do shepherds do?” “I don’t know.” “Really? Do they take care of sheep?” “Oh yeah, they take care of sheep.” “What are sheep like? You know, I’ve seen them. We’ve been to petting zoos. What are sheep like? I mean, what would it be like if we had a sheep in the backyard? I mean, that’s not happening, but let’s just imagine we had a sheep. What are sheep like? Well, how does Jesus care for God’s children like a shepherd? Does he protect them? Does he rescue them? What questions do you have about Jesus being like a shepherd? Do you have a question?” Remember when I said you could do all of this in 10 minutes? Then if you’ll just look at your calendar at some point today, we have your family devotional right there. Remember we’re pushing out romantic notions of it being like Pentecost or them showing up with a journal, going, “Teach me, Father, the ways of the Lord.” Right? That’s not happening. We have seven questions. I’d say your goal is four. Get through four without someone getting spanked or sent to bed, and you just won. You just won at parenting. It’s in the door. You get to pick it up and just take it with you. You have conversations on the way home. You have it. You have your time as you go. I’ve added nothing to your week except to look at your calendar and find 10 minutes in which you can make this family devo happen, with no romantic notion about what’s going to happen other than you’re going to have a conversation about Christ together as a family. We just want you to win, and that’s what I meant by C. We talked about time, and now we want to talk about moments. Here’s how we define moments. Family discipleship moments are capturing and leveraging opportunities in the course of everyday life. Again, in the course of everyday life. You’re not adding anything. This is what’s already happening for the purpose of gospel-centered conversation. What we’re looking for is opportunity in the normal flow of life to turn conversation toward the gospel, to turn the conversation toward the things of God. Now Jesus was a master of this. I know some of you are thinking, “Hey, can you use another example, because he is Jesus?” The Bible tells us the Holy Spirit of God in you if you’re a Christian is making you more and more and more and more like Christ. To look at what he does and to emulate who he is is what the Holy Spirit of God is accomplishing in our souls. The Bible shows us in Luke 21 Jesus is with his disciples in the temple. He sees a widow with two small copper coins. They were called mites. She dropped those coins in what we would know as kind of the offertory plate or box or whatever. Jesus goes, “Okay, boys. Check it out. Do you see the widow? She just dropped two mites, two copper coins, in the offering. I’m telling you, she gave more than anyone else has today.” The disciples are like, “Well, that don’t make no sense.” Now that’s a paraphrase. It’s not going to read like that in your Bible, but… “That doesn’t make any sense. We’ve seen people give much more than that.” Jesus takes the opportunity to teach his disciples about kingdom economics. What God values is not the amount but the heart of the giver. What God wants is not money but the heart of his children. Now Jesus didn’t prep that out. He hadn’t done exegesis, built out his sermon, and got ready to go. He just saw a moment, and he took it. We see in Luke 13, there was a terrible tragedy. A tower had fallen in one of the major cities of that day and killed a lot of people, very much like some of the tragedies that come across our TV screen. He uses that moment to teach his disciples why bad things happen. We see in Mark 10:17 through 27 that a rich man comes to Jesus. The story is called the rich young ruler if you have a church background. He comes to Jesus and says, “…what must I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus says, “You know the law. Do the law.” The rich young ruler lies and says, “I’ve known the law since I was a kid. I’ve obeyed it all.” Liar! “I’ve never broken a law in my whole life.” That’s bull! I don’t care who you are. You’re a liar! Jesus then says, “Okay, one thing you lack. Sell all you have, and give it to the poor.” The Bible says the rich young ruler left heartbroken because he was of great wealth. Jesus, in that moment, turns to his disciples and helps them understand to own things is okay, but to be owned by things is not. There’s a way to be wealthy and free, and there’s a way to be wealthy and enslaved. He took the moment that was there. If you’re a mom and dad of multiple kids, you’ll love this one. In Mark, chapter 10, Jesus is with his disciples, and two of the disciples are brothers. They get in a fight. Did anybody have a fight break out between their kids this week somewhere (in the car, at the house, at the table)? These two brothers get in a fight, and Jesus takes advantage of this moment, of this fight between brothers. They’re arguing about who is going to be the greatest. I mean, if that’s not a brother fight… Sisters don’t get in fights like that. “Who is going to be the best?” That’s a brother fight, full-on, “Who is going to be the greatest?” Jesus stops them and says, “The greatest will be the least of you.” He once again begins to teach what the kingdom of God is like and how what the world values is on its head. Jesus says, “No, no, no. We will not exercise our authority and power like the Gentiles do. Whoever is the servant of all will be the greatest in my kingdom, and whoever exalts himself will be the least.” It’s just a moment. Again, Jesus didn’t wake up that morning and write that sermon and just hope somebody got in a fight so he could spring it on them. It was a moment. It was low-hanging fruit, and so he took it. Jesus is just an expert at this. As we talk about moments this week, you can do this, Mom and Dad. Here’s what we’re going to talk about. If we’re going to take advantage of moments… What I mean by that is in the dozens and dozens of moments that happen every day…in our cars, at our house, on the way to practice, on the way home from practice, on the way to the next practice, on the way home from that practice, as we’re trying to grab dinner, as we’re trying to get them to bed, as we get them up in the morning…we’re going to talk about being observant, we’re going to talk about being prepared, and we’re going to talk about being genuine. If you are single or you’re married with no children, although we’re talking about family discipleship, all we’re talking about is a distinctively Christian way we engage one another for the increased joy of all of us. I’ll come back to that over and over again in this message. Let’s talk about being… Observant. Every human being ever born of man is born with a disposition that’s all their own, which is why if you have multiple kids, you know you have multiple kids. Same environment, same parent, very different kids. Maybe you have one that’s just like a complete optimist. They are always sunshine. Maybe God gave you one who is kind of Eeyore-ish, you know? Just like, “I’m okay.” They’re just not ever getting really high, just kind of a steady, “Meh.” Maybe you’ve been given one of those. Now here’s the key. Let me help. One of the keys to parenting (and I believe one of the calls on your life) is to love the kid you have, not the one you want. We love the kid we have, not the one we want. This is a terrible thing to see in this area, where what we wanted was an athlete, and what we got was a reader. Or what we wanted was a reader, and what we got was an athlete. You love the kid you have, not the one you want. This is huge for you to go, “This is what God gave me. God gave me an Eeyore kid.” That doesn’t mean he is bad, and it doesn’t mean you need to make him kind of a laughy, skippy kid. He is a little mopey. That’s all right. Love him in his mopiness. We love the kid we have, not the one we want. We need to know their dispositions, and then we need to be paying attention. We need to be paying attention. Let’s talk about that. To what do we need to be paying attention? First, I think we need to be paying attention to their sensitivity levels. Let me walk through some of that with you. One of my children had one of their friends came over to the house, and my kids were watching a cartoon. We were just watching this cartoon, and then that kid went home, and we had dinner and went to bed. This kid slept with his parents that night because of the cartoon. It was like Scooby-Doo. It wasn’t like some kind of these weird cartoons that are on. It was just Scooby-Doo. That kid was so sensitive that Scooby-Doo wigged him out, which I’m fine. I mean, what can you do if you have a super‑sensitive soul like that? Praise God for that. You never want to go, “Oh, I wish you were more hardened,” you know? What needs to happen is his folks need to know he is really sensitive like that, and I need to know where my kids are, lest I terrify them without knowing it. We need to be dialed into their sensitivity levels. You need to be dialed in to how the world around them is affecting them. Several months ago, I was in my truck, and I had picked up Reid. Reid and I were heading to… We call it a man date. We were just going to play around somewhere. He said, “Hey, Dad, is Obama going to take my gun?” I said, “What, buddy?” He was like, “Well, a kid at school said Obama is coming to our house to take all our guns. I really like my .22, so I can hide it?” I was like, “Okay, a couple of things. First of all, I doubt Obama himself is coming to our house to get the kind of guns we have. Secondly, I don’t think they’re coming to take our guns. There are too many people to take them.” “I don’t want him to take my gun. Come grab it.” By the way, I know you’re in here. I know when I said that, you actually rubbed your piece. I know that happened, but here. You can be as brazen as you want about that. Just know they have drones and helicopters, and I’m glad you have a 30-round clip with a silencer, but it ends with you being melted and them literally pulling your gun from your cold, dead hands. That’s how that ends. We can be as brazen as we want, but that’s the way it ends. I honestly don’t think it’s coming, but my point is this. My son thinks because of something he heard on the playground that there are government officials coming to our house to take something I like. My son is going, “Will you hide my .22?” I’m like, “First of all, that’s shady, and it would be illegal if that was against the law. I’m not going to help you break the law.” Listen. He was distressed. They know more about the world around us than we think they do. We need to pay attention to how all the talk that’s going on affects them, the brokenness of the world, the fears of the world, how it affects them. We need to be paying attention to those, right? If we’re going to seize moments, we need to make sure how they’re relating to the world around them. You need to watch their relationship with others. At every age group and range, there will be relational drama, because we’re humans. It’s a Genesis 3 world. In the same way teenage girls fight, grown men fight (and literally in the same way sometimes). It happens when you get 6-year-olds together. “That’s mine. Give it! I had it first!” Same thing up here with 40-year-old men. It’s pathetic. Across the spectrum, there is… We need to be paying attention to relationships and how they relate to one another. I think this is the most important. We need to pay attention and be observant to how they relate to themselves. You know you relate to yourself, right? You say a lot of things to you. In fact, I would argue that no one talks to you as much as you do. I have a child who thinks they have to be perfect. Then I have two children who have embraced the fact that they cannot. That’s Chandler house. One is so hard on themselves. Every time they mess up, they’re cruel to themselves. They’re shut down, heartbroken, tearful, inconsolable, to where we’ve had to come in and go, “Where is this coming from? Who told you you had to be perfect? Okay, so if this is because you’re a pastor’s kid, Mom and Dad have made their expectations clear. If there are other expectations on you from other people, you tell them to come see your daddy, because we’ve made our expectations clear.” If I’m not paying attention, what happens if I engage my perfectionist in the way I engage those who have embraced the fact they won’t be perfect? Do you see the kind of damage and harm that can occur if I have one who is constantly beating themselves up for not being perfect and I have two who are like, “We can’t be! Who cares? Woo!”? I’m taking the one who feels crushed by the simplest of failures, and I start going, “Are you kidding? Why would you do that? What were you thinking?” I mean, what am I doing but heaping shame now? So that conversation is over here. “What was that? Are you crazy? I will burn your world to the ground.” But over here, it’s a very different conversation. We need to pay attention to how they relate to themselves. Right? Then from here, we want to move into not just being observant… By the way, if you are single, if you don’t have kids, what have I described here except what’s distinctively Christian relationships? In our Home Groups, in our houses with our single friends, I’m just observing, “Hey, there’s a drift happening here. They’re not normally angry like this.” I just sense an increased agitation in them. I have noticed them getting… They’re usually a little melancholy, but this is getting darker and more and more distant. So I’m going to observe, see that, and be… Prepared. I’m going to engage. For what purpose? To turn the conversation to the gospel. If we’re going to be prepared to engage what we observe, what do we need? We need two things. Mom, Dad, you can do this. We need to know something of the attributes of God, and we need to know something of godly character. Okay? If we’re going to be prepared to engage what we observe in our kids’ lives, in our friends’ lives, in our Home Group members’ lives, if we’re going to do that, we need to know something of the attributes of God. Who God is, what he is like, what we think of when we think about God are the most important thoughts in our mind. Then we need to know something about godly character. Let’s chat about that. When we talk about attributes of God, we’re just talking about who he is, what he has done, what he is doing, what he is like. That’s what we mean by attributes of God. Now if you have kids at The Village Church, every time we have them, we’re teaching them one of five foundational truths. It doesn’t matter what the lesson is, it’s tied to one of these. These five statements are so compact with deep, sound, biblical theology and yet are so simple that maybe if you feel like you’re an infant in the faith, these are some of the best vitamins for you to take. Here are our five foundational truths your kids are learning over and over and over again: Jesus came to save sinners, God is good, God is in charge of everything, God wants to talk with us, and God made everything. We have a CD with music that sings those five things. In fact, my youngest, Norah, for a year would not sing, “G-O-O-D, our God is…” She would say, “G-O-R-D, our God is…” That was a great moment. I was like, “No, God made everything, and he is good, so he gave us gourds. That’s why your mom decorates with those in the fall.” They’re singing it. They’re hearing it. Listen. As a grown man or woman, if you have those five things down…in your gut, not just in your brain…I’m telling you, you’re way ahead of many evangelicals just knowing those five simple statements. We want to know those five foundational truths, and then we can get into the attributes of God. Like, God is wise. He knows what is best. God is generous. He gives what is best. God is loving. God does what is best. God is good. He is what’s best. He is unchanging. God never changes. He is the Creator. God made everything. He is holy. God is complete, perfect, and separate from sin. God is just. He is right to punish sin. He is faithful. God always does what he says he will do. God is always faithful. He is never late. He never breaks his word. He never breaks his promises. He is faithful. God is our provider. He meets the needs of his children. God is merciful. He does not give his children the punishment they deserve. God is attentive. He hears and responds to the prayers of his children. He is sovereign. He has the right, the wisdom, and the power to do all he pleases. God is compassionate. He sees, cares, and acts when his children are in need. He is glorious. He shows greatness and worth. He is a refuge, a place of safety and protection for his children. He is a deliverer. God rescues his children. If you’re going, “Oh no, no, no. You went way too fast there, Pastor,” listen. I told you, we’ve got you. That was just page 22. It’s just page 22. That’s all it was. Page 22. All of that and more. Now let’s chat for a second. If I just know those… That’s what I know. I know those five foundational truths. Maybe I can just remember one of them, right? God is good. I have some of these attributes. I don’t need to memorize all of these attributes. Let’s say I have some of these attributes down. Say your kid struggles with anxiety. They have a tendency just to get really anxious about things. Well, now we can step into that moment of anxiety, and we can start to have the conversation about how good God is, about how he is a refuge for us, how he can be trusted, how we can just ask him to give us strength, to give us courage, and then pray as Mom, Dad, and kid. Think about my kid who thinks they have to be perfect. Do you want to know how often we talk about Jesus coming to save sinners? Do you want to know how often we talk about the forgiveness of God? Do you want to know how often when I’m owning my sin before them I point back to Dad’s need for this? This isn’t some sort of ethereal theology and some sort of ethereal kind of ghostly thing in the air. It meets us on the ground where we are. We’re being observant. We’re prepared enough to have the conversations. We also want to be… Genuine. Here’s what I mean by being genuine. Parents (specifically, religious parents) have a tendency to use the Bible and religion to seek to control their children. God has not asked us to control our children but rather train and grow our children into a knowledge of him. It’s not that behavior is not important. It’s not that grades aren’t important. You need to be really careful when you use the Bible like a hammer. You need to be really careful when you do that. My mom shipped me off to vacation Bible school. Again, that was not because we were religious people. It was because I was a little out of control. If she could get rid of me for four hours, that was just a win. One of my earliest memories of church and stuff is singing to an upbeat tune about how God hated liars. I mean, that sounds more like a dirge, doesn’t it? Like a lament. I just feel like you should bring it down a little bit if you’re going to be singing about how God hates you. At the end of the day, the Bible is clear God does hate liars, but the purpose of the law in its primary sense is to reveal we need a Savior, not to just make us feel overwhelmed and damned in a second but show us, “Hey, you need a Savior. God has made a way.” “I don’t need a Savior.” “Are you a liar?” “Yeah.” “Well, God hates liars. You need a Savior.” Do you see what I’m saying? The law is an MRI; it’s not the cure. It’s an x-ray; it’s not the surgery. We don’t want to use the Bible or religion to manipulate or seek to control but rather to try to shape and encourage and build up in the Lord. When I’m talking about genuine, here’s what I mean. Regardless of how much or how little we’re having to discipline, our children are confident we love them, and we know them. That’s what I mean by genuine. As I was prepping for this series, I read an article by a woman named Diana Baumrind. She said, in her article, that there were two predominant styles of parenting. Here’s what they are. One is authoritarian. Here’s how she defined it. Authoritarian parenting expects their kids to follow the rules but don’t enter into a dialogue with their children to decide what those rules should be. Now when she writes about authoritarian parenting, she doesn’t condemn it or say it’s the wrong way to go. She is saying, “Hey, there are rules. Those rules have been clearly defined. The punishment for breaking those rules has been laid out, and a parent acts on what they set.” She is not vilifying that. She is saying that’s a predominant style of parenting. Then the second type was what she called consultative. She said in consultative parenting, parents have high expectation for their kids’ behavior but are willing to discuss the rules. Let’s do this. I’m going to set this over here. This is kind of Bible over here, and I’m just going to walk over here. Okay? Bible over here. Opinion over here. Are you tracking? I need you to nod or something. The authoritative Word of God can be fully trusted…the thoughts of a 42-year-old with a 13-year-old, 10-year-old, and 6-year-old. That’s what you’re getting. Authoritative Word of God…things we think might be working. I would encourage you to consider the consultative approach to parenting rather than the authoritarian approach, although in her data, which I trust her data… She is not a believer but very wise and schooled in childhood development. She doesn’t condemn authoritative teaching, so if that’s your bag, just keep your bag. I’m just saying I want to encourage you toward consultative. The reason why is I think children feel more valued and understood if they can be heard. Not agreed with but heard. Let me give you a couple of things with a 13-year-old, 10-year-old, and 6-year-old we’ve learned. The first thing on consultative parenting (and this is all about being genuine) is we like to do what we call “peacetime contracts.” Here’s what that means. If you think about strife in the home, it almost always occurs when emotions are elevated, doesn’t it? You get shocked. You feel disrespected. You don’t know what to do, so things elevate. Then things start getting hotter. You start saying things. Now the issue you actually started fighting about (whether or not it’s the room was messy again or they didn’t turn their homework in or whatever) has now escalated to you being aware of all of their weaknesses, and them feeling squelched because they don’t know why you’re freaking out like this. They just thought this. Now there’s all this other damage that has to be kind of backtracked and addressed so you can get back to the heart of the issue. We saw that happening in our own home, so what we decided to do is at the beginning of every school year we sit down and we talk about expectations for school. Lauren and I are polar opposites when it comes to our schooling careers. She was in the National Honor Society in high school, graduated summa cum laude from college in three and a half years (no summer school). Literally. She made two B’s her entire life. Kindergarten through the end of college, she made two B’s. If she were here, she would tell you why those B’s were not her fault. The only thing they said at my graduation from high school was, “Matt Chandler.” Then they handed me the thing. There was nothing before it. There was nothing after it. They might not have even put the “-er” on my last name. They just said, “Matt Chandler” and gave me the empty thing. I did graduate. They mailed me the thing. Then I was in college for six years, and I am not a doctor. I graduated college with a 2.7. You needed a 2.5 to walk. That’s Lauren and me. Lauren and I, first, as a married couple had to navigate this space where, for her, grades mean a ton. For me, I’m not lazy. I can remember almost everything I read. I just didn’t test well. It really wasn’t for me. I don’t like regurgitating. I’m like, “If you’re going to discuss the Protestant Reformation in an hour, I’m going to struggle with that because you’re going to pique my curiosity, and now you’ve lost me because I need to dig into this and figure it out.” That’s why I didn’t do well. I’ve always been of the belief that school is important, but it’s not of the utmost importance. The first thing that had to happen was Lauren and I had to figure out, “Okay, how are we going to navigate this space as husband and wife?” Then we would sit down with the kids at the beginning of the school year and say, “Here are our expectations. I have no expectations that you’re on National Honor Society, but here are my expectations. You’re going to work hard. You’re going to be responsible, which means our homework is turned in on time. We’ve given it our best go. If we studied well and did all we could and we only make a C, then I’m okay with that, but I think you’re probably smarter. We might have to look at how we’re doing life and tweak maybe when you go to bed or how much time…” All that is in play, and we build out the contract of what happens if we fall short of expectations. We write the expectations, and then I give it to the kids. They go back and come up with the punishment for the infraction. Here’s what I learned. Year one, they were far harder on themselves than I would ever be. I got Audrey’s contract. “If I fail a class, I should be grounded from the barn for six months.” I was like, “Dang, girl! How about this? Red pen. Strike it. How about four days? Daddy edit. Okay, on it.” I get Reid’s. “Okay, if I fail a class, I should throw away my Xbox.” “Okay. No. How about we’re just grounded for two weekends (because we only play it on the weekends)? How about we’re grounded for two weekends from the Xbox?” Then once those contracts are done, just to have fun, I bring them up here, and I have one of our administrative assistants notarize it. Then I bring them back home (a copy). I’m like, “It’s been notarized by the state of Texas. I’m just saying now it’s done.” Then here’s what we’ve learned. Here’s what we’ve learned! When something has happened, when there are no emotions involved at all, we’ve already decided what we’re doing. They already know. Year one, I mean, I’m a hero. We could’ve thrown the Xbox away. Instead, it’s just two weekends. We could have been grounded from the barn for six months! It’s just like a week. Now remember I think it was last week or the week before I said kids are a little bit like velociraptors. You know, they’re going to keep testing the fence until they can get through. So year two when we did this, they were like, “I should be grounded from the iPad for three hours.” I’m like, “Well, nice try. Stick with four days.” Still what’s happened is when they fall short, they helped decide the punishment. We agreed when I’m not angry and they’re not angry at what’s fair. I am not offended by disrespect when we’re making these decisions. They feel heard and like they get to speak into the process. If nothing else, they know their daddy loves them, and the reason we’re doing this peacetime contract is I never want them in a heat of some sort of passionate disagreement for them to think anything other than, “Daddy is for me and loves me.” The second thing (and I’ve done this quite a bit) is really and only at this point with my 13-year-old. I have very recently (and it’s been picking up steam) had to go into Audrey’s room and say, “Hey…” Oh, I’m not allowed to use her nickname. “This is my first time with a teenager. I don’t really know what to do here. This is the issue. What should we do? How am I supposed to approach this? This is what I need to happen for your good, for our good, for us to function as a family, but I don’t know what to do. We’ve had this conversation a couple of times, but we’re not getting anywhere. I don’t want to fight you. What do I do? How can I help you? How can I come alongside of you?” Every time she has said, “I don’t know.” So then I have pulled back. I’ve called other friends with kids who are older than mine and said, “Here’s her personality type. Here’s how she kind of works. How should I approach that?” I’ve tried to get some advice, and then I’ll build out a plan and go back and go, “Okay, here’s what I decided.” I don’t go, “What do you think of this?” That’s not what I’m doing. “Here’s what I’ve decided now. Here’s how we’re going to approach that. Do you think that’s fair? Okay, that’s what we’re going to do then. We’re going to give this a try.” Here’s what I know. They sat in last night, so this was a good debrief for us after the sermon. I wanted to just make sure the way I’m seeing it is the way they’re seeing it. Regardless, here’s what I know my kids know about me and their mama: we love them. We just love them. It’s fun because we’ve had some conversations so many times that my oldest is starting to share those conversations with my youngest. I was in the car (this was just very recently…in fact, in the last couple of weeks), and Norah asked when she could get an iPhone. I don’t even have an iPhone. I said, “Well, you’re probably not going to get one.” “Why? My friends have one.” She is a first grader. “These are my friends with one.” Audrey, in the front seat, said, “Well, Dad is not their parent. He is your parent, and he is sorry he loves you so much that at times he is going to say no and make you upset to protect you and lead you in such a way that you become the woman you want to become and he wants you to become.” I was like, “Yeah!” and gave her five. I mean, literally she quoted me to her little sister. I thought, “That’s a win. Let’s just chalk that up as a win.” When we’re talking about being genuine, whether you’re on the authoritarian thing… Again, this child psychologist says there is nothing wrong with it. At least there are rules. You’d be surprised how often there aren’t even rules and how unsafe kids without rules feel. If you’re more comfortable in that authoritarian role, I don’t want you to back off of that. You be you. But I’m telling you, at least consider some sort of consultative parenting where you’re like, “Okay, how do we navigate this?” because you don’t have all the answers, because no one has all the answers. Okay. I want to kind of close our time together with a quote and an illustration. That’s all you have left. “How long is the illustration?” Not long. This is a quote from Paul David Tripp. “In his wisdom, God has crafted a life for us that does not careen from huge, consequential moment to huge, consequential moment.” Praise God. Can you imagine how exhausting that would be? “In fact, if you examine your life, you will see that you have actually had few of those moments. You can probably name only two or three life-changing situations you have lived through. We are all the same; the character and quality of our life is forged in little moments. […] We just don’t tend to live life this way. We tend to fall into quasi-thoughtless routines and instinctive ways of doing things that are less self-conscious than they need to be. And we tend to back away from the significance of these little moments because they are little moments. You see, the opposite is true: little moments are significant because they are little moments. These are the moments that make up our lives. These are the moments that set up our future. These are the moments that shape our relationships.” Growing up, there was a series of TV shows on. In fact, I do not believe there was ever the glory days behind us, right? If you think there was a glory day… You’re like, “Oh, Leave It to Beaver. That was such a golden age.” No, no, no. There has been no golden age. If you think there was, you are blind to the sin and the brokenness of that generation. Our glory day is coming, and it’s not yet been. With that said, I think one of the things that at least was present when I was growing up is that the shows we watched on television (The Cosby Show, Saved by the Bell, Full House… Not Fuller House. Get that weak stuff out of my face. Full House, right?)… These types of shows, at the end of every one of the shows, there was a moral given. Do you remember this? At the end of every show! Let’s do it. Jessie (Saved by the Bell) was high-strung. She had to make the A. Her whole worth and value were built around her grades. So she found some uppers, and she started taking the uppers in order to get everything done and get all her studying done and take all her tests, write all her papers. Then if you remember, she crashed out and then missed her big test and ended up failing. Then at the end of it, she woke up. She was a little hung over. Then there was like quiet music in the background. I don’t know who she was talking to, but some other actor there. She was just like, “Here’s what I’ve learned. I’ve learned it’s not really about the grades, but it’s about friends, and it’s about…” Then here we go. Here come the credits. Jessie in Saved by the Bell just taught us a moral. Or Theo skipped out of the house one night and got with some of his friends. One of his friends brought some beer, and it was in the back of the car. They got pulled over, and they all got busted for MIP (Minor in Possession). Then he had to go home, and there was Bill waiting for him. Then there was this conversation about, “It wasn’t mine, Dad.” He said, “It doesn’t matter if it wasn’t yours.” Then boom! Start to roll the credits. There was a moral presented. In Full House, the same kind of thing happens. There’s this kind of drama or tension. Then at the end, there’s kind of some music. There’s this conversation, and a moral is presented. Well, if you watch TV, that’s gone. There can be no shared moral norms because they’re offensive now. Because who would Bill be to tell his son he shouldn’t be out with his friends with beer in the backseat? Right? I mean, this is the kind of world we’ve inherited. Here’s what I want to point out to you. Some of parenting and some of friendships and some of roommates will be these kind of epic kind of broken moments where there are tears and high consequences. You get to have the gospel talk. Ninety percent of your gospel talks will come in these tiny, little moments, these tiny, little opportunities, where there was just a question asked, or there was something you saw or, “Hey, that’s like the gospel,” or, “If you’re anxious, here’s what God can do in our anxieties. Here’s what God does and addresses in our fears. Here’s how we should think about…” These are conversations. “Here’s what the Lord would have us do in this relationship that’s difficult. Here’s how the Lord would have us handle this. Here’s how we should think rightly about our money. Here’s how the Lord would be pleased with how we operate.” When we are looking at godly character, we’re not just those who point out what’s wrong but who rejoice in what they do well. I have yet to meet the kid who hates encouragement from their parents. Right? When my son does something gentle or sacrificial for one of his sisters, I want to point out that in that moment, he is becoming more like the man God would have him be. He pleased the heart of his dad, and he pleased the heart of God. I don’t want to just go, “Why are you always doing that to your sister? That’s not the way the Lord would have you… What it means to be a man is this.” I want to champion where they nail it. I want to be their biggest fan, but I’m not going to be their best friend, because I’m their daddy. I want them to have best friends. It can’t be me. “Let’s laugh. Let’s play, but I’m your dad.” Moments are picking the low-hanging fruit of everyday life to turn those moments into an opportunity to talk about the gospel. Mom, Dad, you can do this. If you don’t know where to start, you start when you pick up your kid. We’ve got you. Let’s pray. Father, I thank you again for the opportunity just to be together today. It’s a good thing to come together like this. I thank you for just a simple idea of being observant, being prepared, and then being genuine and pray that would mark not just family discipleship here but really how we interact with one another as belonging to the household of faith. So if we’re single or we’re married with no kids, that we would pay attention to one another in ways we might encourage and edify and build up. I pray as moms and dads, where we’ve fallen short, we would just be willing to own where we’ve fallen short and ask your forgiveness and ask forgiveness of those maybe we’ve sinned against and then just trust in your grace. I pray where we need to become more observant, where we maybe need to set some boundaries on ourselves with how much we’re drawn to technology, how much we’re looking at our phone, how much we’re watching TV and not engaging in paying attention, you would help us grow in what it means to be fully present in our families. God, where we feel ignorant like we’re not sure what to do, I pray we would dedicate 12 minutes this week to just looking at an attribute and considering a foundational truth and figuring out how to turn conversation to that. Help us, Father. We need you. It’s for your beautiful name I pray, amen."
3,time,1,"How are we? Doing all right? Great. It’s good to see you. If you have your Bibles, go ahead and grab those. We’re going to be in Deuteronomy, chapter 6. While you’re turning there, let me talk to our first through fifth graders. If you’re one of our first through fifth graders, here’s what I would love for you to do. Will you stand up so I can see you? In fact, because of the lights, if you’re on the floor, stand up in your chair. I don’t know if Mom and Dad usually go for that. I just want to give you permission for a moment before I turn you back over to their authority. If you’re bummed out that you sat in the bleachers and you want to stand on the chair and your parents will brace you and we will not be liable for you falling, then you can stand in your chair also. I just don’t want your first early memory of church being a broken clavicle. So I am thinking of you. Hey guys, welcome to big church. We love that you are here. All right, go ahead and have a seat. Mom and Dad, let’s chat for a second. I know they are in here. What I mean by that is I am well aware that this will be a more wiggly service than normal. I am sure we will hear things we don’t hear every weekend. I want you to parent lights out, but I also don’t want you to feel any pressure that your kids’ behavior over the next 35 minutes is somehow an indictment on your character. So breathe, and let’s enjoy the Word of God together as family. Kids, you bring something to us, both as moms and dads, as well as the church, that we desperately need. You’re not going to understand this quote, but your parents will. It’s one of my favorite quotes ever. It’s from a man named G.K. Chesterton. Here’s what he wrote in his book Orthodoxy. “Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, ’Do it again’; and the grownup person does it again until he is nearly dead. For grownup people are not strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough to exult in monotony. It is possible that God says every morning, ’Do it again’ to the sun; and every evening, ’Do it again’ to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them. It may be that he has the eternal appetite of infancy; for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we.” Isn’t that a great quote? It frames God in a way we don’t tend to frame God. It frames God as being joyful and exuberant and happy-hearted. If we’re honest, most of us adults… I think children can kind of see God that way, but most of us as adults think he’s disappointed and a bit grumpy and somewhat frustrated with us, but he’s really hopeful that one day we’ll be different. Yet Chesterton writes, “No, no, no. What if wonderment belongs to the Lord, and the wonderment of our children is there to remind us that God is a God of wonderment himself?” So I love that quote. We’ve been talking about family discipleship. In fact, last week, out of Deuteronomy 6, we did what’s called the exegetical work of those verses, where we went line by line through it and explained it. Then I said what we were going to do moving forward was we were going to frame family discipleship like this: we’re going to talk about time, moments, and milestones. That was going to be the grid by which we talked about making disciples within the family unit. We said a quick word to singles, that you’re a part of the household of faith. We need you at The Village Church. We need you to engage and interact with the family unit, with our kids. I know personally I love the single men and single women who are woven into the fabric of the Chandler family. They love our kids, speak life to our kids, point our kids to Jesus. Our kids are convinced that they are cooler than we are. We know they are not, but our kids, for whatever reason, think they are. So praise God for that. Let them also point our children to Jesus. We are going to spend our time today talking about family discipleship and time. Let me define time. When we talk about family discipleship time, we’re talking about creating intentional time built into the rhythm of the family’s life for the purpose of thinking about, talking about, and living out the gospel. We’re talking about intentionality around the rhythms that already exist. Last week, we read what’s called the Shema. It was how the Jews, or God’s people in the Old Testament, understood how God educated. Here’s what it says. If you have your Bible, Deuteronomy 6, starting in verse 4: “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart.” Parents, you should be cultivating a heart that loves Jesus Christ. That is what we are to give ourselves over to: to cultivate a heart that loves Jesus Christ. As imperfect as we are, and there isn’t a parent in here this week who hasn’t blown it this week, even after last week’s sermon… We just have. That’s why the grace of God is such a beautiful thing for us as moms and dads. This is our primary place of operating. The next sentence doesn’t matter if we can’t get there. So as imperfect as we are, wherever we are, we’re cultivating a heart that loves Jesus Christ. Then look at verse 7. I love when the Word of God meets us in the world in which we live. That’s what I love about God. He’s not ethereal. He meets us where we actually are. “You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.” What the Bible has just done is not asked you to really add anything to your life but rather to reorient your life around the things of God. It’s not like, “Do what you do, and then on top of that add these things.” Rather, let these things be woven into what you’re already doing. Mom and Dad, my goal is that when you leave here today you will not be paralyzed by the task but be empowered and encouraged that you can do this, regardless of how you’ve come in. You can do this. You can disciple your children. You can do it. You’re going to crush it. I’m just so excited for you. With that said, when we’re talking about time, we’re talking about four things. I’ve gone deep into my Baptist roots, and I’ve made all four of these things start with the letter C. When we’re talking about intentional time, where we dive into the spaces that we already are and talk about spiritual things, we’re talking about four things. First, consistency. Don’t immediately deflate. Let’s talk about consistency. No human being ever, regardless of age, needs to be told something one time and then never again. It doesn’t work that way for you. It certainly doesn’t work that way for your children. If you just take this out of the spiritual world and put it into the one you’re living in, there’s no kid ever who just needed to be told, “Hey, will you not leave this here?” once. That’s not how this works. It’s, “Hey, pick up your shoes. Hey, will you come pick up your shoes? Hey, this is not where your shoes go. Hey, let me show you where your shoes go. Okay, here’s where your shoes go. Hey, what are these?” And you get to where you talk like a crazy person. “What is this? Your shoes. Okay, I know they don’t go here.” It’s consistency. This is how it works. We teach over and over and over again. So spiritual conversations are not one-offs. They’re consistent. We’re consistently having these conversations. Let’s talk, parents. You already are good at this. You are already consistently talking with your kids about things. Let me just guess a couple. I’m guessing that you’re pretty consistently talking about grades or sports or the state of a bedroom. These are consistent conversations. They’re not bad conversations. There will be no drive-by guilting in this series. It’s not a bad thing for you to be talking about the best way to tackle or the best way to keep your eye on the ball, or whatever, with your kids. That’s a good conversation if it’s where their joys are. I’m just saying that you’re already consistently having conversations with your children in the car, at the house, when you sit around at dinner, when you have your bedtime routine, even if your bedtime routine is just screaming, “No, you can’t have water. Get in bed!” You’re consistently having conversations. Most consistently, those conversations need to be about the things of God. Now here’s what I don’t want you to do. One of the things that might be most helpful for you is when I’m talking about consistency I don’t think what that means is you go, “Every Monday night at 7:00. That’s a locked-down night. Nobody is doing anything but concentrating on the Lord Monday night at 7:00.” Here’s what I think you’ll find. If you’re able to do that, praise God for you. You are at a whole other level than most humans I know. I think what you’ll find is the second you make Monday night sacred, the entire universe will set its face against your Monday night. Practices will be moved there, and travel will be moved there, and all sorts of crazy things will happen on Monday nights. What you can do consistently is say, “At some point this week, we need to find 10 to 12 minutes to, as a family, read the Bible and have a conversation.” You can do that. Here’s where I want to wager. By the end here, I want to show you that you can crush this with 10 minutes of intentional thinking. You need 10 minutes a week of intentional thinking, and you’re on a roll making disciples of babies. That’s awesome. Consistency. Don’t be so hard on yourself. The second C is clarity. What I have learned with adults, and even more so with our children, is that what is being said isn’t necessarily what is being heard. Has any other parent had this experience? I have it with adults all the time, where I’ll get an email like, “I can’t believe you said that in your sermon.” I’ll just send them the link to the sermon. I’m like, “I didn’t say that.” “You did say that. It was a different sermon.” It’s just funny that what I’m saying oftentimes is heard differently. That’s monumentally more true with my children. All of life is a fight for clarity. Here are some best practices with your kids. When you get into a spiritual conversation with your kids, which you’re doing consistently… When that conversation is kind of tapering off, what we’ve learned to do is just go, “Hey, say back to me what we just said.” Parents, this is great, because it’ll start to give you a little bit of insight into the soul of your child. Each soul is unique. I have three individual souls. You have to come at them each a different way. You have to deal with them each a different way. There’s no “one size fits all” in raising children. It’s a complex, competitive sport. In this space, what I’ve found is that one of mine will almost always tend toward the negative side. “Can’t do this. Can’t do this. Can’t do this.” I have two who trend toward the positive side. “This is great. This is awesome. This is great.” I have learned by just saying, “Say back to me what I just said to you,” that I need to navigate this heart a bit differently than I need to navigate these two hearts. Another best practice is to ask open-ended questions of your children. If you ask yes/no, you’re going to get yes or no…if that. You might just get a grunt. If you ask open-ended questions, you at least have a shot. If you ask, “How did that make you feel?” that’s an awesome question for a mom or dad to ask their children. Don’t think I don’t know half the wives in here said, “Look, I don’t think my husband could answer that question.” You know, “How does that make you feel?” “What?” Like, panic in his eyes. So what you do next is you go to basically a scale for them. “Did that make you angry? Did that make you sad? Was it kind of an angry sad? Were you happy about that? Did that make your heart happy?” Here’s another great little statement to say: “Tell me more about that.” These are great ways to have conversations with your children that get at their hearts and not just their behavior. Behavior is a good thing that needs to be addressed, but what we want is their hearts. We learn that from our heavenly Father. We want the heart, not just behavioral modification. I want some behavioral modification, but what I ultimately want is their hearts. As you fight for clarity, make sure you’re becoming a safe place for their doubts. If you’re a Christian, how many of you have had these seasons or these situations in your life where you’ve had to really wrestle with how to make sense of God being good, holy, just, and beautiful in the scenario in which you live that created some doubts you had to wrestle through? I think that’s going to be a universal experience for even Christians. We know what’s right. We lean into what’s right. We preach the gospel to ourselves, but if the apostle Paul can say he was perplexed but not crushed, I think that gives us permission to at times be perplexed. Be a safe place for the doubts of your children. Be a safe place for them to say things like, “I just don’t…” I have one. One of my kids, who will remain nameless, he… Dang it! He’s built like his daddy, which means he’s just a natural skeptic. So my son is going to say, “It’s hard for me to believe that God created the whole world. I know he created the lions and tigers, but it’s just hard for me to believe he created everything.” Every time he says something like that, I just take the little nugget he gave me… “How amazing is God, then, that the apex predators you just named, the strongest, most aggressive hunters on earth, he just told to be? How awesome is that?” Those moments can become watermark moments, where he’s more and more likely to discuss spiritual things with me because I don’t freak out when he airs his doubts to me. Be a safe landing spot for them. Be a place for them to wrestle with, “How is this true? What do I do with that?” So we want to fight for clarity. Mom and Dad, as you go and you’re doing the things you’re doing, be creative in your approach to how you’re tying things back to the Creator of the universe. When I talk about being creative (that’s our third C), let me give you some examples I’ve picked up from other parents. I had a buddy who did not have this conversation with his wife before he did this. Brothers, have this conversation with your wife. He built an epic fort in their living room. I mean, he moved the dining room table into the living room. He moved chairs. He used a nice lamp to hold up a blanket that created the canvas ceiling, and then they all crawled into this fort with a flashlight, because flashlights are always cool if you’re under the age of 41. With the flashlight, he clicked and read this out of the Bible: “The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.” Then under this blanket, in the middle of the living room… This brother has a big ol’ family. I’m just saying he’s a kid away from a TLC show. With them all jammed in there, flashlight lit, they began to pass the flashlight around and talk about God being a fortress and what that meant. You can do that. Dad, you can build a fort in the living room. Just loop in Mama. I know a good friend who goes camping. The Chandlers are not campers. There are certain aspects of the Chandler family that are not interested in camping, so we don’t camp. It’s just laid down. No camping for the Chandler family. If that’s you, will you enjoy that for me? Because we don’t camp. I have a buddy who goes camping, and they do the whole deal. I mean, he has the super tent. Have you seen this? It looks like something out of Star Wars, like rooms in the tent. They’ll go out camping, and they’ll do s’mores. They’ll start the fire and roast out the s’mores, and after the s’mores, as they’re getting close to bedtime, you’ll be able to look up, and there are these things you can’t see that are called stars. They’ll look up at the stars. Think about how fast this is. As they’re camping… The purpose of camping is not to do a family devotional. They just like to camp. They like to hike. They like to fish. They like to get out in nature. Now that they’re out there, he’s just going to look at the stars and, in a matter of five minutes, read, “When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him?” You can do that. Dad and Mom, you can make s’mores. You certainly can read two sentences and talk about it. You may be like, “Well, I’m just not smart.” You don’t have to be smart to make s’mores and look up at the sky and go, “Isn’t God amazing?” This isn’t complex. This is as you go, as you do what you do. Go for a walk. Sing worship songs together. If you have a kid who loves a specific worship song, print it out and let them read the words and tell you about the song. This is as you go. This is low-hanging fruit. One of the things my youngest has owned for our family is every time we have dinner, we do highs and lows. “The high of your day, the low of your day. Go.” I’ll sometimes forget. We introduced it years ago, but sometimes a brother just wants to eat his dinner. But Norah now has owned that, and she’ll go, “Highs and lows, oldest to youngest. Dad, go.” So we’ll say, “Hey, this was my favorite part of the day, and this was my least favorite part of the day.” A couple of things. First, there is no yes/no quick answer to that. Sometimes there’s, “I’m not sure,” but there’s always a low. It’s a relative scale. There’s always what’s your least favorite part of the day. Sometimes that’s, “I had to get up this morning” or “You made me take a shower.” But now we’re getting insight into what they see as a high and what they see as a low, and it’s just a fun game to play at dinner. Nobody has to think about that. I don’t have to prep anything. It’s just, “Okay, we’re eating. Highs and lows.” You can play that in the car as you’re chucking nuggets back to them. Again, you can do this. I think anytime you eat dinner out, you have a golden opportunity to talk about how good God has been to you. You eat dinner out, you can talk about the graciousness of God in providing for Mom and Dad the kind of money that enables you to go out and enjoy this. Not everybody gets to do that. Because of where we live, we probably think everybody gets to do that, but it’s simply not true. So God has been kind that we’re able to eat out. I think anytime you can surprise your kid with any little thing, that’s an epic way. Think of how often our God surprises us with out-of-nowhere encouragement, out-of-nowhere confrontation for our good, out-of-nowhere building up. Think of how often the Holy Spirit invades with a moment of unforeseen joy that explodes out of nothing. Think of that day that you wake up three minutes before the alarm and it surprises you. Think about when you have abounding energy that you’re not quite sure where it came from. Anytime we can surprise our kids, we can tie that back to our Father who loves to give good gifts and surprise his children. I have another one. We have never tried this. I don’t know that we ever will. When they get together for dinner, they do the ABC’s of praise, but it has to be tied to something God has given their family. So they’ll go, “A…what is something God has blessed our family with that begins with the letter A? B…what is something God…?” Here’s what he’s doing. He’s training his family to think about how God has blessed them. He’s creating a culture in which they’re not constantly talking about what’s not right or what’s wrong or what they wish was better but, instead, cultivating hearts of gratitude around the dinner table. I think that would start a fight in my house. One of my kids would be like, “I always get G!” Yet he’s cultivating. He’s giving it a shot. Finally, you have counsel. Mom and Dad, we want you to crush this. We want you to be the Michael Jordan of family discipleship. If you’re a little bit younger and you don’t know who that is, shame on you. You’d better not say a word to me about LeBron James or something like that. That’s like church discipline stuff. But ultimately, we want you to just dominate family discipleship. So here’s what we’ve done. We have tried to just loft it to you to crush. So if you’re not quite sure what to do, here are some examples. If you have a first through fifth grader and you’re in here, let’s just talk about your normal routine. I don’t know what your normal routine looks like other than you’re at church here. Maybe you have a billion practices you have to go to this afternoon. Maybe your world is chaos, but you’re here now. So here’s what we do for you. Every week, if you have a first through fifth grader, when you go pick up your first through fifth grader, we have a sheet waiting for you. Bam! It is divided up into time, moments, and milestones. This is last week’s sheet. So you go pick up your kid. Boom! You have the sheet. You’re in the car on the way home. Here’s what we have. Here’s what they learned today. We have the answers for you. We have the text they studied. So first question. “Today you learned that Jesus is the healer. What example of his healing did you learn about?” Now we’re at 40 to 60 percent that you’re going to get the, “I don’t know” answer. Right? “I don’t remember. I don’t know.” That’s just a given. We’ve got you, fam. We put the answer on the page so that you could go, “Was it this?” “Oh yeah!” We’re not hanging you out to dry. We’re going to make you look like geniuses. Question two: “What is the difference between power and compassion?” What are you going to get on that one? “I don’t know.” Got you. On it. “Is it this?” “Oh yeah!” What are you doing? You’re spending intentional time on the drive home. I’ve added nothing to your world except picking up a sheet and reading. Then guess what? We have your family devotional. We have the text for you, and we have the questions that go with it. There are nine questions here. If you get through four of them, you won. When we’re talking about family discipleship, specifically when we’re talking about a devotional time, you need to remove every bit of romanticism out of your head for that moment. Nothing like Pentecost is going to happen in your family time around devotional. Here’s what you can expect. A kid will be threatened. One will probably be sent to bed early. One might get spanked, and I can guarantee you there will be some time out. When we do ours, we have four rules we make each one of our kids read out loud before we start. So not one reading for all. Every one of them reads the four rules. Number one: “I will not ask questions that have nothing to do with what we’re talking about.” Rule number two: “I will not get up and go to the bathroom.” Rule number three: “I will not lay my head down on the table.” Rule number four: “I will not doodle in my journal.” Four rules. Audrey reads them. Reid reads them. Norah reads them. We start. If you get through four questions, you crushed it. You can do that, Mom and Dad. We’re here for you. Maybe you’re like, “Well, I have a 4-week-old. How do I do that?” I love it when you ask questions that line up with my notes. If you have to go to Little Village to pick up your infant, we’ve got you. Again, you can grab this. I purposely grabbed the 0 to 6 months one, because that’s an area where you’re like, “What do you do for that?” Great question. What we did is we broke down on the front page how they’re developing right now, what’s going on in their minds, what’s going on in their motor skills, and how they see relationships and kind of the emotional development. Then on the back… This is how easy this is for you. Playtime. We’re not asking you to play with your kid. We’re assuming that you’re playing with your 4-month-old. So while you do it…Boom! Some thoughts. Do you feed them? This isn’t heavy stuff. “Man, I have to feed my kid now? When am I going to do that?” You’re already doing it. We’re just trying to come alongside of you and go, “While you’re feeding, here’s some great conversation to have.” Drive time. You know you’re an unpaid Uber driver. When you’re driving them, have that chat. When you’re bathing them. What about when you’re putting them to bed? See, Mom and Dad, you’re already doing this. This is just intentionality. It’s there every week. You need only pick it up. What if you’re an overachiever? I know you’re here. You’re just like, “Okay, but what if I want more than that?” Boom! Got you, type-A-ers. These are just more resources. What we’ve tried to do is distill it all down to make it as easy as possible, but maybe you’re like, “I don’t want your ease. What if I land in a different spot?” Again, we’ve got you. You want resources on parenting teens? Boom! Several books. Discipleship and devotional? Several books. If you’ve been in a divorce, you’re a single mom or dad, some books to think about. You have a kid with special needs? Books for you. You have a kid in some awkward adolescent stages? We have some books. Bible study books, dating, sex, and marriage books, DVD series. All you have to do is pick it up and take what you want. I’m telling you, when I’m talking about counsel, we’re here for you. We have worked our tails off just to lob this thing for you so you can crush it. We’re here for you. That’s the C…counsel. We want to serve you. We’re not experts in everything, but we can read, distill, and provide, and that’s what we’re doing over and over and over again. So pick these things up. If you haven’t grabbed one of these guides… I don’t think we’ve ever created anything better than this. As we’re talking about time this week, if you went to the section on time that comes right after modeling, you see that we basically gave you… This is easy stuff. Here’s what it might look like. There are a bunch of questions on family discipleship time that you can think through how it best fits your family. We’re all individual families. We operate differently. Then from that, we have an example, and then…Boom! What would yours look like for this week? We’re not asking you to build out a three-year plan, because your kids are going to shift every six months. It’s just here for you. This is our counsel. Now let me land our time together with this. Here’s my conclusion. I think there are four great enemies to us seeing this become really fruitful in our homes. Let me walk through those quickly. The first very real enemy is what I’ll just call misplaced loves. Mom and Dad, if we’re not cultivating a heart that loves Jesus Christ… No guilt, no shame. I’m not asking if you’re perfect. I know the answer to that. But have you given yourself to cultivating a heart that loves Jesus Christ? As we’ve said so often, are you filling your life with things that stir your affections for Jesus? If that’s not there, your kids will pick up on what you love most. You will talk most about what you love most. So if all you ever talk to your kids about and the most consistent things you talk to your kids about are sports, grades, and looks, you are modeling to your children that this is where your worth is found, and nobody really wants to do that. Nobody wants to convince their kids their worth is how they perform on a football field or soccer field or water polo pool or whatever they’re doing. If you’re like, “Are you going to wear that?” and all we ever do is address their external prettiness, then we’re sowing into them, “Your value is actually tied to this.” We make disciples whether we think we’re making disciples or not. I’m not saying these aren’t important conversations. I have oftentimes said, “You’re not wearing that. Go change.” And not because it was inappropriate, but just because they shouldn’t have been wearing it. “Space cowgirl isn’t happening today. Go and change.” It’s not that we don’t address these things. It’s just not the most consistent thing we address. Are you tracking? You can do this. The second thing is weak marriages. I want to be really careful here, but I want to be really pointed. If your marriage is marked by consistent coldness, that’s a hurdle. I’m not talking about you have a season where you’ve grown a little cold or you have a week or two that you’ve grown a little cold or a day or two that things have gotten cold. I’m not talking about that. That’s just marriage. But if you have an extended roommate kind of thing going on, then address that. I think one of the best gifts you can give your children is cultivating the relationship you have with your spouse. I think one of the best gifts you can give your kids is to gross them out a little bit by how you flirt with your spouse. They might be like, “Oh gosh! Gross!” but really they feel safe. So cultivate that. The other thing you have to watch in your marriage is if things are always 170 degrees. If there’s constant violence, constant screaming, constant fighting, the temperature of your home is always really elevated, with stress, and they don’t know when you’re going to explode, Dad, or when you’re going to freak out, Mom, those things need to be addressed. I’m not talking about a one-time moment, because everyone in this room has had moments in their home that if anyone else could peer in and watch that moment, they would think we were insane. I’m not talking about these one-time moments. Those give us opportunities to model the gospel by owning our sin, seeking the forgiveness of our children, and trusting the grace of God. I’m saying if this is a consistent deal, get help. Men, just to help you, if your wife thinks this is a consistent deal, listen to her. Women, by and large, are more discerning than men. It’s why beautiful women look in the mirror and go, “Oh my gosh, I’m gross,” and a dude who has gotten completely out of shape looks at himself and is like, “You’re welcome, baby.” That happens, because women have a tendency to be a bit more discerning than men do. So listen. If your wife is saying, “The temperature of our home is hotter than it should be,” don’t give her a list of reasons, as you scream at her, of why that’s not true. Just listen and fold into help. The third enemy is non-present presence. You and I are a part of a sociological experiment that everybody is starting to realize is a mistake, and no one knows what to do about it. First of all, let’s talk about this experience. How many of you went to your phone to check an email and an hour later found out you were looking at cat videos on a website and don’t know how you got there? The pull and allure of constant information is so profound. There were some studies that came out recently that said everyone texts while they’re driving, and if they say they don’t they’re lying. The reason is every time your phone goes ding, or whatever noise it makes, the part of your brain that’s hungry to accomplish fills with dopamine. The phone has trained us that we’re successful every time it makes a noise, so the pull is too powerful for us. What it has created is a culture in which we’re present but we’re not there. I hear parents all the time talking about their kids and their devices. Well, a couple of things. First of all, I’m guessing they can’t afford a $600 phone. Somebody could. It wasn’t them. I haven’t met the sixth grader yet who’s like, “What shall I do with this grand?” The second thing I would say is I’m wondering if you are as critical of what you’re modeling to them as you are of their usage, if there might be some balance found. Non-present presence is a serious issue in our day and age. We’re missing out on much. The last couple of concerts I’ve been to, when the band plays their biggest song, literally every screen in the joint goes up to record a video. You’re actually not watching what you came for to record a video that more than likely you’ll post somewhere and just get really frustrated about and delete three months later when you try to record something else and find out you have no space on your phone. So you delete it real quick to put another video on that you’ll post and forget. This is what we’ve done to ourselves. You will have to create some space where the bullying effect of your phone does not rob you from the opportunity to be present. I think the last great enemy of what we’re talking about today is a lack of intentionality. Mom and Dad, listen. I said I wanted to end with this, so let me end with this. I think you can do everything we just talked about with 10 minutes of thought. Here’s what I mean. Already you’re crushing it. You’re at church. You have your kid at church. You have a sheet you can just take with you. So what if you sat down on Sunday night with your spouse…? Men, husbands, I have never met a wife who would not love for her husband to say, “Baby,” (or Boo or Sweetheart…whatever you call her) “Bring your computer. Let’s sit down and look at the week.” You open up your calendars and you go, “When are we going to gather the family for 10 to 12 minutes to consider the things of God together? Okay, it looks like we have a window Tuesday from 3:00 to 3:45. Let’s plan on that. Go ahead and put it on your calendar. I’ll let the kids know, and we’re going to sit down as a family, and we’re going to walk through what the church gave us. We’re going to have a good time. Is there any way to be creative about that? I think they have a little line here that says, ’Here’s how you can be creative about that.’ So put the Google away. We’re on it.” Then as you go, as you’re driving them to practice, you’re opening up conversation. You’re going after their hearts. You’re talking about the things of God. You can do this. Now let me just say this. I’m going to say this at the end of every sermon in this series. I think when we have these conversations there are a couple of things that can start happening. First, we can start feeling like we’ve failed. Maybe our kids are a little bit older. I’m starting to see… I have a 13-year-old and a 6-year-old now, so I can see the gap that’s in those things. There are some ways I can interact with sweet Norah that I interact very differently with my 13-year-old. My 13-year-old doesn’t play dress-up anymore and come in and spin around and want me to make a big deal out of it. Instead, she gets dressed in the clothes she’s going to wear today and wants me to make a big deal out of it. Changing clothes 37 times is my youngest and my wife. It is not my 13-year-old right now. We interact differently. So I can feel a sense of loss with my 13-year-old, because I can see how my 6-year-old interacts with me. But Mom and Dad, nothing is too late in Christ. “Well, my son is 40.” Okay, praise God for your 40-year-old son. Let’s chat about that, since you brought it up. I think you’re right in that I don’t think you’re going to call your 40-year-old and say, “Hey, family discipleship time is at my house this week at 3:00.” That day is probably over. What you can do is pick up the phone and say, “Hey, this is a random call. I love you. I’m so proud of you in these areas. You know, at my church we were talking about family discipleship, and as the pastor was speaking, I just thought, ’Man, I wish God had done a pronounced work in my life earlier in my life so I could have done these things.’ I did the best I could, son. I love you. I wish I had known more. I wish I could have done more.” At that moment, we own our sin before God and before others, and we trust the grace of God. If they’re 40, their decisions are theirs. Their life is theirs. You are not responsible. So I want to lay before you that it is never too late to do the most distinctively Christian thing there is, which is to own sin before God and others, trust his forgiveness and grace, and move on, happy-hearted in the peace that Christ brings. So if you feel conviction, if you feel paralyzed, if you feel like you don’t know what to do, hear me. It’s a new day today to get up and start again. I say to you all the time God doesn’t have any regrets concerning you. He doesn’t look at you and go, “Man! I totally regret this death and resurrection thing now that I look at this brother.” That’s not happening. Remember the G.K. Chesterton quote. Could it be that he goes, “Again! Again!” even with you? Surely it could be true. Mom and Dad, you’re going to crush it this week. Let’s pray. Father, thank you for our time together. Thank you for our first through fifth graders who have done so well in here today. I preached way longer than expected, so thank you for that grace. I pray for Mom and Dad so that their hearts would be encouraged, that their belief that they can do these things would grow. In those areas where we need to own our sin and seek forgiveness, I pray that we would do that. Father, where our marriages need to be addressed, I pray that we would step into that and begin to seek counsel and help in that. Where we have some things we’re just not quite sure what to do, I pray that we would seek out others, that we would grab resources, and that we would try to grow and learn and understand as we live our lives. We thank you for football and basketball and baseball and golf and water polo and softball and a billion other activities. We thank you that those are common-grace pleasures you’ve given to us to enjoy. I thank you for our school systems and our educational systems, which are so good, but I pray that our conversations would most be about you, most be about your beauty, most be about your glory, that moms and dads would cultivate a heart that loves you, and that ultimately our homes might sing with the melody of your grace. It’s for your beautiful name I pray, amen."
4,modeling,1,"Good morning. How are you? Doing well? Excellent. If you have your Bibles, go ahead and grab those. We’re going to be in Deuteronomy, chapter 6. I want to thank you for the grace afforded to me to do ministry in other places. I’ve been out the last couple of weeks. I got to spend some time in Rome. Just for the building up of your own faith, there in Rome at the Acts 29 European conference we had 280 ministers and their wives from 27 different countries. Sermons were being translated into multiple different languages, all in the shadow of the ruins of the greatest empire to ever rule the earth that at one point was hell-bent on killing us and destroying us all, and yet I paid 15 euros to walk through their ruins. Let it build up your heart to know that the most aggressive schemes of man against the people of God will always fall flat. You can go check out the pyramids. You can go check out the Colosseum. It’s a marvelous thing to be preaching the Word of God and hearing it in the back of the room being simultaneously translated into French, Spanish, Italian, and Russian while realizing that that starts to gather up borders that went well beyond the borders of the Roman Empire. Here’s something to consider. Rome ruled the known world for 1,500 years. The United States is still in Pampers. This was a brutal, powerful empire, and here we are. Not only are we here, but we’re flourishing in a way that would have blown their minds. They threw everything they had in regard to earthly power, and we simply spread. Let that build up your faith this morning. Regardless of what’s on the horizon for us, as we see increased secularization, as we see the losses of things we thought… It looks like we’re on the twilight of what was an unprecedented experience of Christians having cultural and political favor, and we can see that vanishing. I just don’t want you to be nervous or panicked about that. Christian courage and trust in the Lord will be the undoing of every empire that stands against it, and we have a lot of historical evidence on this end. So be of good cheer. The God of the Bible reigns on high. With that said, we’re going to start a four-week series today on Family Discipleship. I need to say a couple of things to lay the foundation before we dive into our text. Not only for today, but really for all four weeks we’ll be back in the same text. Let me start this way. We believe the God of the Bible is true and that he is the only real God and that he has created everything that exists, including certain systems and structures, for two ends. The first end is for the glory of his name, and the second is for the joy of his people. When God designs or works things, he’s working them for his glory and our joy. We believe that. We embrace that. In fact, when my time is done as your pastor… I don’t plan on ever pastoring another church. I plan on being with you until it’s time for the old crazy guy to step aside and make space. “He’s crazy now. Those were such good days, but he has lost his mind. Let’s find another guy.” You won’t have to tell me. I already have other guys who are going to tell me when they see it coming so I can transition out peaceably and we don’t make this a tomb. My plan is to be with you for the long run by the grace of God. I just got back from Rome, and I couldn’t wait to get here. You for me, this for me is a very generous gift of God. I love being here, being with you. You’re what I think about when I go to sleep at night. You are the object of so many of my prayers. So when my time with you is up, I want in the deepest parts of your soul for you to know that all that God has done and all that he has designed and all that he has wired is for his glory first and foremost (I’m not the point and you’re not the point) and, secondly, for my joy. God’s ways are always better than our ways, and the Word of God always lines out for us what is best for us. When the design and plans and commands of God are submitted to, humanity flourishes. We talked about this in A Beautiful Design. When we see and hear the Word of God, when we submit to it…“You’re God; I’m not God; I’m going to let you be God; I’m going to do things your way”…then mankind flourishes. I’m not talking about financial flourishing, although we see some of that. I’m not talking about you getting everything you want, because your wanting is not always in accordance to what is best for you. What God has for you is what is best for you. Ultimately, when we rebel against that, when we think we know better, destruction always follows. It might not for a week. It might not for a month. It might not for a year, but eventually, to reject and buck against God’s good design is to sow into your soul and, therefore, into your life destruction. When we’re talking about family discipleship, we’re talking about how God designed things to be and how he designed things to work, and if we will submit to these things (we’ll get to our imperfection already before we even start the series here in a minute)… If we’re submitting to God’s good design, we have a beautiful shot to really flourish as families and, therefore, flourish as a community of faith and, therefore, flourish as a community and, therefore, flourish as a state and, therefore, flourish as a nation. We can boil it all the way down to that. So I want to lay that as the premise of this whole series, and then I want to say a word to our singles. A good portion of The Village Church is made up of single men and women. You might be thinking, “What in the world is this series going to have to do with me?” I’m so glad you’re asking that question, because it’s the next part of my notes. It’s just providence that you’ve asked that and I have a little section here to talk about this. When the Bible begins to talk about the church, it talks about the church in interesting language. Let me give you some of it. Galatians 6:10 says, “So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.” Then again in Ephesians 2:19, he’s going to use this same language, household of faith, except he’s going to tweak it just a little bit. In Ephesians 2:19 he says, “So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God…” The family is a picture of what God is doing globally. He has made for himself a people, both universally and localized, and he is that place’s Father, and we are his sons and daughters. What I want you to hear and understand as a single man or a single woman is that God has called you into this place locally as part of his household, and you very much have a place in the discipling of men and women and families in this congregation. Maybe there are two separate ways to think about it. The first way is that the church is filled with broken, recovering people. Correct? The church is filled with people whose lives are not in the ideal vein of what God would have for us. Sin brought about some destruction. There are broken homes in this room. There are single moms and dads in this room, either because of the destruction of sin and death or because of the destruction of sin and relational brokenness. That’s just the reality. There are no perfect people at this church. Anyone pretending to be perfect shouldn’t be trusted. So what an opportunity for a single man or single woman to participate in serving and helping and coming into those spaces and giving of themselves for the building up of the body. Maybe the second way to illustrate this… My wife and I would not consider ourselves perfect parents. In fact, we’re probably hyperaware of our failures and inconsistencies as parents, but we’re in our children’s lives, and we go after our children’s hearts. By the grace of God, there are two young beautiful godly single women… They shouldn’t be single women. Men, I don’t know what in the world you’re doing. If you’re like, “Well, who are they?” email me your résumé. I’m not outing them here. What these two young women have done is they’ve taken my 13-year-old daughter, and they just encourage her and love on her. They are to her a preacher that is different than her daddy and her mom, while all the while reinforcing the beauty of Christ, reinforcing the glory of God, reinforcing that what the Scriptures say is true. We need this as parents. We need those who will pour into our children who are other than us. So you have a huge role to play. That’s not even to start with the fact that you are a son or a daughter. You are already part of a family unit, even if what I’m saying about the household of God doesn’t persuade you. I will unapologetically be talking to parents during this series, but from time to time I want to go, “Okay, here’s a good space for you to play. Here’s a good place for you to step in and really use your gifts and use how God has designed you to build up the household of faith.” Just hear me. You have a big role to play in a very real way. You become the mortar that holds together some broken spaces. I want you to embrace that and relish that and guard your heart against downshifting into, “This doesn’t have anything to do with me,” because this has tons to do with you. Now parents, let’s do this. If you’re the parent of children… Your golden retriever doesn’t count, but if you’re a parent, will you stand with me? I promise you you’re not going to be embarrassed or anything like that. I’m just going to try to encourage your heart. Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to lay the ground level right out of the gate. If you’re a parent, how many of you normally sane people have at one point or another just lost your mind at one of your kids? No, keep your hand up. Don’t do that thing. Keep it up. Parents, look around. Isn’t this good news? You’re not the only one who freaks out. Now put your hands down. How many of you, in a good desire to discipline and shape your children well, have disciplined probably more aggressively or a little bit farther than you needed to? Okay, put your hands down. One of my aims over the next four weeks is not to do this drive-by guilting of how terrible parents you are. Let’s be honest. This task is epic and feels impossible, so I don’t want to do a drive-by guilting. I want to encourage your hearts. In fact, I want you to say this with me really quickly. I’m going to say it, and I want you to say it back to me boldly and like you want to believe it. “I don’t have to be a perfect parent.” Say it. You don’t, because you can’t be and you’re not. Breathe. You’re not, and here’s the great news: God hasn’t asked you to be. It is not the expectation of God that you be a perfect parent. He knows you can’t be. He knows you won’t be. I also want to lay this before you: regardless of how you’ve snapped or what you’ve said or how harshly maybe you’ve punished here and there, you have ruined nothing. Look at me. You have ruined nothing. Today is a new day. With that said, I want us to dive into this text. I just want to walk through what the text is. Deuteronomy 6 is called the Shema. It was for the Jews how education was to work, how they were to commend the works of God to the next generation. As we read it, here’s what I want you looking for. It’s three concentric circles of how education works or how family discipleship will work. When we say family discipleship, what we’re saying is how we disciple our families to treasure Christ as Lord. When we’re talking about family discipleship, we’re saying, “We’re, as a family, going to follow Jesus; here’s how that looks.” In the Shema, we see concentric circles on how this works. It starts in the center. It cannot start anywhere else. You can’t start at the outer ring and work your way in. Nor can you start in the middle ring and work your way in. You must start at the center, and then after the center is established, you will simultaneously be operating in all three rings. The first stage is the most important. Without it, we have no series. With that said, let’s look at this. Deuteronomy 6, starting in verse 4: “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.” May God bless the reading of his Word. The first sentence of the Shema is a theologically rich and profoundly beautiful sentence about the unity in the Godhead. We’re not going to unpack this one with a lot of vigor this morning. “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.” So here’s what we know: who we’re educating the circles about. We’re educating the concentric circles about, “The Lord our God, the Lord is one.” The God of the universe is the subject matter of discipleship at every level. From there, it starts with circle one of three concentric circles. Look there in verse 5: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart.” This is a fascinating text. First, we see circle one in Christian discipleship is you and me loving the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our soul, and all our mind. I want to point out a couple of things. First, it’s fascinating to me that he doesn’t say, “Do the Ten Commandments, and teach your kids to do the Ten Commandments.” He didn’t say, “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Here’s the code you must submit to and obey in order to teach the next generation how to be my people.” No, he says, “Love.” Why? Because you do not do by what you understand to be right or wrong; you do by what you love. It is not your understanding of right and wrong that motivates your actions; it is love that motivates your actions. The Lord, the God of the universe, not wanting you to be constrained to what you do not love but rather what you know is right or wrong, and your life is filled with nothing but a long history that reveals you don’t do what you know is right or wrong; you do what you love. This is why you order what you order at restaurants. You know what’s good for you. That doesn’t stop you. Why? Because you love. I mean, you’re looking at it, and you’re like, “Mm, yeah. That superfood salad looks good, but so does that cheesecake.” You go with the cheesecake. Why? Because it’s what you love that motivates the direction of your life. Have you ever really paid attention to your kids? If I think about my kids, I have one in particular… In this area of this kid’s life they are so disciplined and driven. They don’t forget anything in this domain. They never forget. They’re on it. Then the rest of their life is this messy train wreck. You know why? Because there’s a lot of love over here, and there’s not a lot of love over here. This kid knows what’s right and wrong, but it’s not their knowledge of right or wrong that motivates and drives; it’s what they love. We are a people who are not primarily thinkers. We’re a people who are primarily lovers, and it’s what we love that drives and motivates our lives, which is why the Shema doesn’t start with, “Do what you know is right.” If you’re thinking education, aren’t you thinking, “Tell me the rules and the dos and don’ts”? That’s not where God starts. God says, “No, love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.” Now a big question is, “Okay, how do you do that?” Well, the Scriptures create a lot of freedom here, but there are always certain pieces. First, there’s the truth of the Word of God. I think I lean on this a lot. I want to lean on this a lot. I think there’s a big difference between… If we’re talking about love and really building a love for Jesus Christ into our lives, we’re not talking about dry Scripture memorization; we’re talking about steeping in the Word of God. You know how you make a good cup of tea? You don’t make a good cup of tea by putting the bag in there, pouring it, and then immediately taking it out. You let it steep. You let it sit for a while. Because we’re a culture so built on speed and efficiency, meditation, quietness of heart, considering, and meditating upon the Word is necessary for us to grow in love. An acquisition of knowledge devoid of its connection to the heart does not get us where the Lord would have us. I want to lay before you really quickly that without this first circle, you are bucking against God’s design for the family and have begun to sow seeds of destruction into your family. Let me try to say it this way. For the family to be all that it was designed to be, we must be Christians. You can moralize your family. I would never say you can’t have from a worldly perspective what looks to be a great family, where you laugh and your kids say, “Yes, ma’am. No, ma’am. Yes, sir. No, sir.” That’s moralizing. If the God of the Bible is true, that is not ultimately a win. It’s not ultimately a victory for you to have upright, moral kids who are really respectful if, ultimately, we have not taught and sown a love for Christ, which is the way to the fullest life possible, which is what we want for our kids. That’s what I want for my kids: the fullest life possible. It’s found in Christ. It’s not found outside of Christ. So we can’t even talk family discipleship if we’re not talking about you cultivating a heart that loves Jesus Christ, Mom and Dad. It’s interesting in this text that he’s not giving responsibility to the dad or to the mom but to the family. Now why would the heart of the parents for Jesus play any role in family discipleship? Let me lay two things before you. First, God’s design is so thorough and so effective that you are discipling your children right now. You’re discipling your children. You’re discipling your grandchildren. There’s no way around it. God’s design is so thorough, so good, that you are making disciples. The question is…What are you discipling them in? So if we could chat for just a second. Again, I’m about to say some heavy things. I’m saying these ultimately for what I hope to be your good, maybe your repentance and submission to God’s design. Men, if you are aggressive toward your wife, if you verbally belittle your wife, if you refuse to serve your wife like Christ loved the church, you train your sons to be the next generation of narcissistic, self-seeking cowards, and you train your little girl that that’s what she can expect from men. That’s how you’re making disciples. Ladies, if you are a consistent nag and consistently feel like you have to be the Holy Spirit in the home, a couple of things. First, I’ve never met the man who has been transformed by the nagging of their wife. I’ve never met the man who’s like, “You know what? Now that you’ve said that for the six thousandth time, I’m in. I’m going to change.” It’s just not how it works. In fact, even the Bible would feel sorry for your husband. God says it’s better for a man to die in the desert than to live in a home with a contemptuous wife. Think about it. God is like, “Yeah, man. Um, you should just go to the desert. No, don’t take any water. Just go.” “Am I going to die?” “You’re going to die. It’s going to be slow, it’s going to be awful, and it’s going to be better than this. So go.” Listen, ladies. When you’re constantly nagging, you’re training your sons in a way that emasculates them, as you emasculate their father in front of them, and on top of that, you’re training your daughters that the way to get what you want is to constantly chirp and nag about somebody’s weaknesses rather than being an expert in your spouse’s strengths, even if they’re hard to find. I’m not giving your man a pass. He could be an incompetent moron, but he’s your incompetent moron, so you need to grow in your understanding of what he does well and speak that into him in front of your children. We are modeling; we are making disciples right now. That’s why this is so important. If we’re growing and fueling a love for Jesus Christ, we begin to extend grace to one another. Even when we do get a bit “naggy,” even when we do say things we don’t mean, we’re quick to apologize and own our sin in a way that models for our children the need we all have for Jesus Christ. This is massive: that you would love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might. A few weeks ago, I talked about the primacy of filling your life with what stirs up your affections for Christ. For me, this is such a compelling idea around discipleship. You want to know the generosity of God? Here’s this big command: “Work on loving me.” How great is that? Just pay attention to my heart. What stirs up my affection for Christ? I’m just going to jam my life full of what stirs up my affections for Jesus. I know that involves the Word of God and meditating and steeping on that. For me, I love coming together with the people of God. I love singing with the people of God. I love those things. Those things are commanded. God has given us those things as things that stir up our affections. I don’t know if notes are the best things to do in the gathering. There’s something about just experiencing being together as the people of God as the Word of God goes out. If you’re type A, you keep doing notes. I know how difficult it is to even try to do it off of me. Good luck to you. What else stirs your affections? I like the early mornings. I don’t know what it is. Early mornings make me feel closer to God. I’m not any closer to God in the morning, but I feel that way, so I’m going to get up. There are things that are nowhere in the Scriptures that by simply giving myself over to them I feel my affection stirred for Christ. That doesn’t feel heavy handed to me by God. “Come on! Quit trying to make me love you.” It doesn’t feel heavy handed. It feels freeing and delightful. It means the Christian should be marked by joy, because what we’ve been set free to do, even as we stumble and bumble and are still broken, is to pursue an ongoing ever-heating-up love relationship with God. That’s a beautiful freedom we’ve been given. That takes us to the second circle. The first circle is you growing in a love relationship with Jesus Christ. Then it moves to… I’m going to read verse 6 and on to verse 7. Let’s look at this. “And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart.” That’s circle one. Here’s circle two. Verse 7: “You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.” Mom and Dad, the first circle is you stirring your affections for Christ over and over again with everything the Lord would give you to stir up your affections toward him. That’s sweet. Then circle number two is “Teach them diligently to your children.” Now let’s talk. When I read that sentence, let me tell you what immediately pops into my head. What immediately pops into my head when I read, “Diligently teach them” is “I don’t have time for another set study of the Bible.” I have football practice on one given night. I have a barn to take a daughter to on another one. I have gymnastics to get a third one to. Everybody has something. My wife is in the training program. I’m just trying to get everyone fed, showered, and in bed before 10:00 at night. I don’t know when I’m going to teach the doctrine of God to the three Chandler babies. What? Is it 6:00 on Monday? I’ll tell you, there’s a lot going to invade 6:00 on Monday. Is it Tuesday night at 9:30? That’s going to go real well the next morning when we try to get everybody up for school. When am I supposed to do this? But the text itself so serves us. It’s like God knows we live in an actual world and these things aren’t ethereal. Let me show you that you can do this. Let’s look at the text. “You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house…” How many of you sit in your house? Boom! You can do this. You’re on it, because you have a couch. You sit in your house. What about “Walk by the way”? Any of you drive your kids places? Look at that. There’s no more beautiful place to trap your children than the car. They have nowhere to go. We’ll talk about this more as we move forward. If you punt that time to devices for them, then we’ve already sabotaged the opportunity to have all sorts of gospel conversations, to hear their heart, to pull from their heart. I’m not saying that’s easy. In fact, you have to work at thinking of questions that can’t be answered with “Yes” or “No.” You’re going to have to work, because your kids 90 percent of the time… “How was school?” “Good.” “Good normal or good special?” “Good.” Right? Is this your experience? Every once in a while they’ll open up their heart and throw up on you, but most of the time you’re going to get one-word answers, so you’re going to have to work at it. We’ll talk more about that. So you’re in your car. You have a place to sit in your house. That’s awesome. You’re like 50 percent of the way there in regard to “diligently teach.” Do you guys go to bed at night? Okay, what about do you wake up the next morning? You have all you need right now, then, to diligently teach. What are we diligently teaching? We’re back to concentric circle one. Remember? I said if you do circle one, you’ll eventually do all three of these circles without thinking about which circle you’re in. What are you teaching them about? You’re diligently teaching them the first command, that you would love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might, and now you’re diligently teaching that to your children. Now when are you doing that? You’re doing it when you’re sitting around the house. You’re doing it when you sit at your dinner table. Please sit at the dinner table. There is a night to chuck chicken nuggets at them in the back of the van. There is that time, but there must also be time where we’re sitting together. I don’t want to preach or teach this like we’re not living in the world we’re living in and the time we’re living in. We’re not in BCE here. We’re not an agricultural society, where the kids are coming to work for me and working in the field. There is a time when you get through the Chick-fil-A or when you don’t even try Chick-fil-A because that’s like a four-and-a-half-hour wait in line. You figure out how to get nuggets to them. There is a time to do that, but we have to establish at least some consistency around the table. Later in the series I’ll give you all sorts of sociological information about just what eating dinner together does. It really is stunning. As you sit in the house, as you’re in the car, when you’re going to bed at night, when you get them up in the morning… Again, I’m not trying to over-romanticize this. There are mornings in the Chandler house where breakfast is a ZBar, a lot of screaming, maybe some juice, and “I can’t believe you lost your shoes again.” Then there are other mornings where it’s bacon and eggs and prayer before school. It’s inconsistent. I love what he says here. Actually, the first-century Pharisees… You want to talk about adventures in missing the point. Look at verse 8. “You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.” What the first-century Jews had done is they took a box and put the Shema in a box, and then they bound that box to their forehead. They literally walked around with boxes on them that had the Shema. They took this text literally. They had the Shema on their hands. Again, this is an adventure in missing the point. As I was saying earlier, it’s not just about reading and memorizing; it’s about steeping and knowing. What the Word of God is commanding us is that the Shema…to love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our soul, and all our might…is to become the lens by which we see the world and the motivation by which our hands work. That’s how we see the world: through the lens of, “Our house is going to love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our might. This is what we’re about.” So now we’re going to talk about that when we sit down. We’re going to talk about that in the car. We’re going to talk about that when we lie down at night. We’re going to talk about that when we get up in the morning. It’s going to be inconsistent, and we’re going to have a lot of opportunity to own where we failed, and one day at a time, over a long period of time, God is going to do some cool things. Parents, let me take this off you really quickly. You will not, by your parenting, save your children. Did you hear me? The power to save is not in your hands. I say this because one of the things we’ve experienced at The Village Church for 13-something years now is a slew of men and women who have become Christians in their 30s who will say, “I got baptized when I was a kid, but I did not believe or understand but felt it was really for my parents.” I will oftentimes use a joke that’s not a joke. It’s actually based on a real story of what happens when you tell a 6- or 7-year-old, “Do you want to come to heaven with Mom and me or would you like to burn in hell forever?” You laughed, but that’s based on a real conversation with a grown man who, with no joy in his heart and sin ravaging his life, considered himself a Christian because he was baptized when he was 7 with no understanding and no desire to really follow the Lord. He was convinced he was a Christian, because it was important for his parents to look holy and look all together for their church friends. One of the reasons we built out the baptism class for children and for parents is to help assist you in this, because we want to believe the best about our kids, don’t we? I want to believe the best about my kids. The second they say something like, “Jesus died on the cross for my sins,” we’re like, “He’s a Christian. He is.” My son said that to me once. He was riding his little tricycle and said, “Hey, Dad, Jesus died for me on the cross,” and I was like, “That’s right, buddy. And then what happened?” He said, “And then the Easter bunny brings me candy.” We want to serve you, parents, with your children to make sure they grasp it. Christ does save, can save 5- or 6- or 7-year-old little children. My wife’s testimony is that Christ grabbed ahold of her when she was 7, and that’s her story. It’s a beautiful testimony. I want that testimony for my own kids, but let’s be careful not to press our children to make claims of faith that we have made and they have not. Be encouraged. It’s a long game that, by the way, isn’t done being played once they leave your house. I didn’t know that. I mean, you have kids and they’re just kind of your kids forever. We keep praying. We keep loving. We keep owning our sin. We cannot save them. We can put kindling around them. We can point them to the joy found in Christ. Our homes can be places filled with life and vitality, rooted in the gospel, but we will not save them with persuasion. But the Spirit of God can, so we pray and we cry out and we plead and we hold fast and we expect. That takes us to the third circle. Look at verse 9. “You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.” I hope you see what’s happening here. You have almost a cascading effect out of an individual soul. So you have Mom and Dad, who are both committed to seeing a love for Jesus Christ be preeminent in their lives. They’ve jammed the schedule filled with what stirs affections for Christ. They’re talking about Christ in the car. They’re talking about Jesus when they go to bed at night. They’re talking about Jesus inconsistently, really wobbly, sometimes not fully, but they’re doing the best they can with where they are. They have no expectations or visions of grandeur for their lights-out parenting skills. They’re just doing the best they can with where they are. Then the family unit begins to glow, and now not only is it written as lenses by which they see and as what’s on their hands, but now it’s on the doorposts and the gates. Now the community is beginning to see the beauty of God’s good design and life submitted to the design of God for the family. You cannot start here. You cannot start with outward-facing ministry. You start with outward-facing ministry, and in many ways the Scriptures would condemn that ministry. Do you know that for a man to even be considered an elder he must have loved his wife and children well? Why would that be the standard for eldership, a man who serves and loves his family well? Because you can’t have externally-facing ministry that is spiritually wrought if your soul hasn’t overflowed into your home, because in many ways your home is sometimes the most difficult people to love. You’re around each other all the time. You see each other’s weaknesses all the time. If you get praised outside… Everybody knows your weaknesses in your house. People don’t so much know your weaknesses outside of your house, but everyone living in the house with you knows that you have some weaknesses. So it becomes easier for the glory of the outside world. The Bible goes, “No, no, no. That’ll destroy your soul. It’s loving the Lord your God in your heart, and then in your home, and then out of there it begins to overflow.” So I would kind of draw this linear line. An individual, Mom and Dad, whose hearts are stirred for Jesus Christ. In the car, in bed, in waking up in the morning, and even in some set times here and there, they are talking about, thinking about, pointing to the beauty of loving Christ that then transforms that home in such a way it begins to shine brightly in a darkening world. Where do people come when the darkness begins to overcome them? If a marriage gets difficult and people haven’t bought into the façade of suburban Instagram marriage… When marriage gets dark and difficult, those men and women, if by the grace of God they’ll take a step forward, go to those whose marriage seems to be in a healthier spot, and ask advice and ask for people to help. The same thing is true for children who see the light of Christ shining in a home. They’re drawn to that family. They’re drawn into the health of that family, the stability of that family. Then when you have a family unit that’s shining out that has come together with a covenant family of faith in which God is the Father, then you have a group of families that form a greater family that becomes a bright light in the community. So you have a church that shines the light of Christ to the community, and then from there, the community can be drawn into it or repulsed by it based on the state of their heart. Then you have the opportunity to affect community, state, and nation, but it all boils back to the basic family unit. So over the next three weeks we’re going to be covering family discipleship. We’ve worked very hard on creating this for you. I think this is the best thing we have ever done. It’s for free in our lobbies or, if you’re more digital, you can hop on the website and download it. Here’s how over the next three weeks we’re going to talk about family discipleship. We’re going to talk about time, moments, and milestones. There’s your series. Next week we’re going to talk about time. When we’re talking about time, here’s what we’re talking about. When we say family discipleship time, we’re talking about creating intentional time built into the rhythm of the family’s life for the purpose of thinking about and talking about and living out the gospel. We’re going to talk about that next week. That’s the sermon for next week. This is the text for next week. You have the guide if you want to start to read ahead, although my sermon will be somewhat different but aligned with. The week after that will be family discipleship moments. When we talk about moments, we’re talking about capturing and leveraging opportunities in the course of everyday life for the purpose of gospel-centered conversation. Your children are going to present to you a thousand opportunities to have gospel conversations. My fourth-grade son does it. My 6-year-old daughter does it, and my teenage daughter certainly in the drama that is being a teenager presents us hundreds of conversations. Just talk about the kindness of Christ, what it means to be gospel people, the wisdom of God in relationships. These are great conversations we have in the car, that we’ll have at dinner, that sometimes we have as we’re chucking chicken nuggets back to her to eat on the way to the barn before we rush to middle-school Bible study. Our last week will be on family discipleship milestones. Here’s what we mean by milestones. Milestones are marking and making occasions to celebrate and commemorate significant spiritual milestones for God’s work in the life of the family and the child. All of this is right here. Parents, look at me. You can do this. If you’re like, “Man, I’m overwhelmed right now. I’m barely breathing right now.” Okay, but we’re not adding anything. We’re just saying as you live. This is a simple guide that’s going to help in ways I can’t even really unpack. It has been prayed over, and we’re desirous to see God do a profound work in your family’s life. So please grab one of these. If you’re single, please grab one of these. Time, moments, and milestones works in an apartment filled with dudes. You can do this. I thought one of the ways we could end is by taking a passage in the Scriptures that’s about what it means to commend the majesty of God to the next generation, that we might read it out loud, rejoicing in the truth of God’s Word together. We’re going to read nine verses of Psalm 145 together out loud. Why don’t you do me a favor? Why don’t you stand, and we’re going to read this together. You’re going to read loudly over my voice that’s amplified, and we’re going to let the Word of God wash over us as we consider the faithfulness of God. Starting in verse 1: “I will extol you, my God and King, and bless your name forever and ever. Every day I will bless you and praise your name forever and ever. Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, and his greatness is unsearchable. One generation shall commend your works to another, and shall declare your mighty acts. On the glorious splendor of your majesty, and on your wondrous works, I will meditate. They shall speak of the might of your awesome deeds, and I will declare your greatness. They shall pour forth the fame of your abundant goodness and shall sing aloud of your righteousness. The Lord is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love. The Lord is good to all, and his mercy is over all that he has made.” Let’s pray. Father, we thank you that this is true, that you are slow to anger, that you are abounding in steadfast love. You are good to all. We thank you for your mercy toward us, your generosity toward us. We thank you that as we are, as inconsistent as we are, regardless of where we are on this line of progressive sanctification, you long to use us to shape and mold our sons and daughters. If we’re singles in here, you use us to shape and mold those around us and other units we could enter into. We thank you and praise you that you would use us as we are. You’re gracious and good and kind. We pray that you will stir our affections today. That is the key, affections that burn hot for you. We pray that even this gathering today will have encouraged our hearts to a greater love of you and desire to see you amplified and magnified in our homes. So even today as we get in the car, even today as we sit around the living room, even today as we lie down later tonight, and as we get up tomorrow morning, would you be on our minds? Would you be on our lips? I thank you that we don’t need to be theological giants to do this. Capture our hearts, Father. It’s for your beautiful name I pray, amen."
5,parenting for years,1,"Hey guys, good morning. I’m Mr. Jamin. If you would, turn with me in your Bibles to Deuteronomy, chapter 6. We only have these Family Worship Weekends a handful of times each year. I’m grateful for them. I love that we do them. If you’re new, this is not what every weekend looks like. If you come back next weekend, it’ll be very different. I think one of the things that’s really special about it for our campuses, while we are the youngest campus of The Village’s five campuses, we have the second most amount of children, the second most amount of families. So next to Flower Mound, we have the most kids in Little Village and Kids’ Village every Saturday and Sunday. What I know about us, about our attenders, our members, is a lot of you are parents, but not just that. A lot of you are parents of young kids because of the ages of Little Village and Kids’ Village, so we have a lot of families here. You parents, you’re all very in love and multiplying, which is great. Praise God. In light of that, what I want to do is consider two passages where the Lord instructs us in regard to parenting, and I want to do so within a certain framework. A couple of months ago, our campus pastor, Hunter Hall, was preaching, and at one point he made a comment about parenting. He said, “The days are long and the years are short.” It hit me on the cusp of my oldest turning 4, so I found that statement profoundly true, because I’m standing at my 4-year-old’s birthday party thinking, “There’s no way. This is impossible. He can’t be 4. I don’t even remember him being 3. I remember him being 2 for sure, but I don’t remember him being 3.” My time with him is a breath. In that, realizing that the years are short, realizing the brevity, my hopes for him, my desires for him, my hope for the future is just so pure and righteous and eternal. I realized I am a more faithful parent when I focus on the fact that the years are short versus focusing and dwelling on the days being long. When I am thinking of the long game and thinking eternally and thinking about the brevity, I’m more faithful and more committed and just a better steward of what the Lord has given me. There’s something that’s implicitly Christian about that, because as Christians, we live our lives in the present based on what we know to be true about the future. We steward the gifts God has given us, the talents, the challenge, the mission God has given us… We steward it now based on knowing that one day in the future we’ll give an account. We are faithful in trial and faithful in temptation and faithful in suffering because we have a hope in the future. We live today based on what we know to be true about tomorrow. So there is this eternal-type mindset we have as Christians, and I think based on these Scriptures we’ll look at in a few moments, we are to have this eternal-type perspective in raising, rearing, and caring for the kids the Lord has given us. So let’s look at these passages, starting with Deuteronomy 6, verse 4. “Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one! You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your [children] and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.” Deuteronomy 6, starting in verse 4, is a foundational passage for the people of God in the Old Testament. It’s called the Shema, which shema in Hebrew just means hear or listen. It’s this call to worship. It’s twofold. The first part is a confession. The confession is this. It begins by saying, “The Lord is our God. The God of the universe has a special and unique relationship to us that is different than the relationship he has with the rest of the earth.” Then not only is the Lord our God, but the Lord is one. That doesn’t mean God is one, speaking of his Trinitarian nature, although that’s true. What it means is God is one. He’s all there is. He stands alone as the one true God. All of the surrounding nations have a claim that their deity exists or that they worship this god or this thing or this image. All of those claims to deity are false and bogus, and we know there is one God, the one true God, and he is all that’s worth living for. Because the Lord is our God and he’s the one God, we respond to him in a very specific way. We love him with all of our heart and all of our soul and all of our might. All of our being is devoted and surrendered and submitted to this God who is our God, the one God. The overflow of that kind of love is that we teach that truth. We teach those convictions. We pass them on to our children. But it doesn’t carry just the idea that we teach it to our immediate family, to our kids. The idea is you’re teaching it to your children in such a way that they’re teaching it to their children in such a way that they’re teaching it to their children, so you don’t just have a family who believes, but you have a whole lineage of faith, a whole family tree of those who would say, “I love the Lord, the one Lord, the only God, with all of my heart and all of my soul and all my might.” For some of you, that’s the kind of lineage you live in biologically. We stand on this side of the cross, so what the people in the Old Testament looked forward to in Christ’s coming we look back on, his death and resurrection. Our confession is that Jesus is all. Jesus alone saves. We know and follow him, and he has made us right with the Father. That’s our confession. Some of you are in that kind of lineage, where you’re in here, and you came to faith because your mom and dad believed and taught it to you, and in God’s grace he saved you, and their mom and dad believed and taught it to them, and so on and so on. Others of us would sit here and say, “My family name is not a good one. If you look back through our lineage, if you look back up into my family tree, it is riddled with dysfunction and abuse and addiction and could overall be characterized by a rejection of the one true God, by a lack of love with heart, soul, and mind.” You’re sitting in here today, and you say, “You know what? But I want that. I want that kind of lineage. I want to be this line of demarcation, that if you were to look at my family history, there would be a moment where those kinds of things stop and the honoring of the Lord, the obeying of the Lord, the righteous living begins, and that line of demarcation is me and my family and the faith the Lord has given to me that I then pass on to my children who pass it on to their children who pass it on to their children.” What Deuteronomy is going to say is there’s a very specific way you do that. There’s a very specific way you instill that kind of faith in the generations that follow after you. Verse 7 says, “You shall teach them diligently to your [children] and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up.” What’s the point? That encompasses every movement of the human experience, except for swimming. The idea is that in everything you’re doing, walking, lying, rising, sitting, you’re talking about these truths. You’re declaring the truth of who God is and what God has done. If I were to summarize that in a modern context, the point is your faith is an everyday reality, not a weekend event. It’s not something you just enter into and exit out of depending on the context or the seat you’re sitting in or the people who are around, but it’s something that has so gripped your heart it permeates every aspect of your existence, and it’s always on the front of your mind and the tip of your tongue. Wherever you land on that spectrum, everyday reality to weekend event, no one will expose that in us like our kids. It’s a very vulnerable thing to ask your kids. “What does Dad talk about most? What do you think Mom and Dad care most about? Based on what we say, based on what we buy, based on how we act, what do Mom and Dad care most about?” Ask your kids, “What’s the sermon you most often hear preached that’s reverberating off the walls of our home? Is it the school sermon? Is it the work sermon? Is it the money sermon? Is it the Jesus sermon?” Here’s what we need to know. Nothing will make Christianity more unappealing than for our kids to see us dichotomizing between real life and religious life. Nothing will make it weaker to them, more unattractive and unappealing, than for them to see us making a distinction between the way we live when we’re in a sacred setting versus the way we live when we’re in a secular setting. “This is what we do around there, and this is what we do around here.” The other side of that coin is nothing will make Christianity feel more like home for our kids than for them to see us radically committed to the gospel of Jesus both inside and outside the walls of the church. That’s not always pretty. It’s not always this watershed moment. I took my son on a hike a couple of months ago, and we were at a park just north of my house on this trail. People mountain bike there and trail run and walk and everything. So I’m walking along with him, and we get to this fork in the trail, and there’s a sign there. There’s an arrow pointing one direction and an arrow pointing the other direction. One direction is the easier path, and the other direction is the difficult path, the hard path. My son Asher and I sat down on this log and had a conversation. I said, “Hey, here’s what’s going on. Here’s what that sign means. What do you think we should do? Which way do you think we should go?” He said, “Dad, we should go the easier way.” I said, “Why?” He said, “Because it’s easier.” I felt so intelligent. Four years of Bible college. I said, “Well, I understand that, but here’s the thing. Jesus was once given a choice. Jesus was tempted in the wilderness by Satan, and he was given a choice to take the easy way. ’Just worship me, and you can have all the kingdoms of the world. You can take the easy way out.’ But Asher, Jesus chose to go the hard way. Why? Because he loves us, and he loves the Father. We follow Jesus, and we live our lives for Jesus. So what do you think we should do?” He thought about it. He looked at me and said, “Dad, I think we should go the easy way, because I don’t want to die on a cross.” I thought, “Fair enough. I mean, I didn’t really pack for that.” The point is not that it’s always going to be some sort of home-run conversation. The point, though, is that it could always be a conversation. It’s always something that’s on the front of our minds and the tips of our tongues that is working itself out, so our children see we’re thinking about it every day in every aspect of our comings and goings in life. Then don’t miss verse 8, because verse 8 is an important piece of understanding this and navigating through this. He says, “You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.” This is not for the watching world. In other words, this isn’t the modern equivalent of the Jesus fish on our car. It’s not so that other people see and say, “Oh, okay, they’re a Christian.” The idea is that it’s on our wrists. It’s on our foreheads. It’s on our doorposts. It’s ever before us so that we remember. Why? Because we’re prone to forget. We’re prone to be pulled away from these truths. We’re prone to forget there is one God who’s the one true God. We are broken, and our nature will sometimes manifest itself in us worshiping lesser things, chasing false gods. It’s the wrestle of the Christian life. Implicit in this is the reality that we are going to fail and we are going to fall and we are going to need to confess and repent, and our children desperately need to be brought into that wrestle. They need a front-row seat to watching Mom and Dad fall and get back up, fail and repent. Some of the most meaningful moments for me as a kid were when my mom and dad would apologize for something. Like when my mom would come into my room and say, “Hey, I spoke to you in this way, and I’m sorry.” Or my dad would come in, and he would say, “Hey, you observed this about me earlier, and I need you to know that was not righteous, and I’m sorry. It offended God and it offended our family, and I repent. I apologize.” It was meaningful to me because, first, it made me feel loved. It’s relationally healthy to have that practice. But I also identified with that, even as a kid, just being broken and having a broken heart and identifying with the fact that they were showing me there is space in the Christian life to fall and get back up. They mirrored that in their life. More than I needed my mom and dad to be Jesus, I needed my mom and dad to need Jesus. I needed to see them demonstrating that in their repentance, in their apologies, and demonstrating the fact that Mom and Dad are not my savior. There’s a far better Savior, the one who saved them, the one they follow. So in this modeling for our kids, in it always being on the front of our minds, the tip of our tongues, we also need to know we welcome them into the character, the pattern, just this rhythm of repentance, where they see it’s okay to not be perfect. It’s okay to be broken. It’s okay to mess up. Let’s look at Psalm 127. Deuteronomy 6 gives us this behavior as parents, this eternal type of model for parenting. Psalm 127 gives us this picture of who our kids are to us, of what the intention is for them. “Unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who build it; unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman keeps awake in vain. It is vain for you to rise up early, to retire late, to eat the bread of painful labors; for He gives to His beloved even in his sleep. Behold, children are a gift of the Lord, the fruit of the womb is a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are the children of one’s youth. How blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them.” Someone asked me after last service what that means. It’s the Bible giving you permission to throw your kids at people. “They will not be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.” We read the whole psalm for a reason. On first glance, it might seem like it’s two different psalms. “Unless the Lord builds the house…” That’s like a construction worker psalm. Then “Children are a gift.” That’s the parenting psalm. In reality, these psalms together highlight one truth, and that is all human toil, all human effort, is worthless unless it’s blessed by God. That’s the point. We are missing it unless we see our work and our city-building and our leadership as being dependent on God, from God, and we miss it as parents unless we see our children as gifts from God. That’s what they are. They are a gift from the Lord given to us that we might steward as an act of worship unto him. There are a couple of dangers when it comes to parenting. Instead of seeing our gifts, there’s a danger that we see our kids as god and make them god and center our lives around them to where they determine the climate of the home. Instead of us seeing them as gifts and worshiping the Giver, we see them as that which we should be worshiping, and we place our children as the uppermost in our affections and allegiance. One of the signs that our kids are god is when authority in the home becomes disordered. Instead of it being God, marriage, children, it’s children, and then everything else in whatever order. Then when they’re god, we start saying yes to things God has already said no to. When children sit in that place in the home… Whatever is uppermost in affections, whatever is uppermost in submission, in devotion, everything else after that is dispensable. Everything else after that becomes something you could potentially sacrifice on the altar of whatever the greatest thing is. So it’s for the man who says, “You know what? I might not be a very good husband, but I’m a really good dad.” It’s impossible. It’s a contradiction. Why? Because you are the one your sons are looking to to learn how to treat a woman in the way you treat their mom. You are the one your daughters are looking to to create their expectation as to how they should be treated by a man by the way you treat your wife. They’re not mutually exclusive. They’re integrally connected. When the child is god, everything else is dispensable, and authority in the home becomes disordered. They run everything. There’s another danger, and that is seeing our kids as a burden. Our culture propagates this. Our culture, Hollywood, the media is pitching this idea that the greatest season of human existence is when you are young, first job, in college, have nothing tying you to anything. Very low commitment. You can spend money how you want to spend. You can spend time how you want to spend. Then you get married, and you get to travel. Then all of a sudden, children come into the picture, and you have these little humans who are oozing from every orifice on their body, and it’s just this buzzkill. It takes your time, takes your money. It’s just this drain. The idea, then, is that children are this burden. They’re just a task. They’re just something I’m now responsible for. The sign that children have stopped being a gift and started being a burden is that our provision for them becomes predominately physical. Pay the bills. Feed them. Don’t invest emotionally. Don’t invest spiritually. Just do the bare minimum of what it takes to keep them alive. The school can educate them, the church can indoctrinate them, and I’ll write the checks. Writing checks is easy. Knowing your kids takes work. Hearing their heart takes work. Knowing how God has wired each of them differently and what they need takes work. But it’s worth it, because they’re not a burden; they’re a gift. God has given them to us as a gift. The sign we’re seeing our kids as a gift is that we steward them in a holistic way. Not just physically, but we steward them mind, body, and heart. We give an account for all of those. The youth pastor is not going to stand before God and give an account for your kids. The children’s minister is not going to stand before God and give an account. We are going to stand before God to give an account for our own children. The responsibility of discipleship falls on us first. So part of the evidence that they are a gift and we’re seeing them as a gift is that we are taking responsibility for those things. It’s going to create in us this appreciation for the Giver of the gift. If somebody gave you a brand new car, like a 2016 whatever…tax title and license…they just gave you a brand new car, one of the ways we would all know a year from now how appreciative you were for that gift is how well you took care of the car. If it’s trashed out and there are stains everywhere and you never got the oil changed, it means you really didn’t appreciate the gift and didn’t appreciate the giver of the gift. But to take care of it and steward it well is a reflection of honor and appreciation to whoever gave you that thing, whoever gave you that gift. Similarly, the way we steward our kids is an act of worship unto God as appreciation. “God, you entrusted me with this. You gave this to me.” The difficulty is that so often familiarity is the enemy of appreciation. Once we get used to something we no longer appreciate it as much. I went to Israel a year ago, and we spent six days in Jerusalem. Jerusalem is gorgeous. It has incredible architecture and incredible buildings, and the remains of the temple are still there. It’s just incredible. When you get there, you just walk around, just looking up, taking pictures of everything, and writing notes about everything. There’s this awe, and you’re just kind of mesmerized. Yet there’s a group of people who don’t care anymore, who are not mesmerized: the locals. This beautiful cathedral in front of me… To the guy walking on his way to his job, it’s just the building he passes every day on the way to the market or on the way to the bus or on the way to work. Familiarity often starves out appreciation. So part of the work for us, as parents, is to be diligent to protect that, to not get used to that, to remember what it was like to hold that child for the first time and be filled with joy and awe and a little bit of terror and appreciation for what the Lord has done, in every single season. Right now I’m in a sweet season with my kids. It’s a chaotic season, but it’s a sweet season. My oldest is 4. My youngest is 18 months, and anytime I leave the home or return to the home is an event. Anytime I go to work there’s a funeral. It’s like freaking out and crying and weeping and gnashing of teeth and like, “How could you?” I’m pulling out of the driveway like, “Why do I do this? Why do I go and provide for them?” I just feel horrible about myself. But when I come home, they’re waiting at the door, and it’s a party. I open the door, and it’s like, “Dad, look at this thing I drew. You’re not going to know what it is. Look at this mess I made.” There’s just this elation. It makes you feel incredible. It’s a shot of confidence. It’s not always going to be like that. When my son is 16, I’m going to come in and be like, “Hey, buddy,” and he’ll be like, “Sorry, Dad. I have to shave my beard.” Each season is unique. Each season is special, and we honor God when we show our appreciation in our stewardship and in our thankfulness to him for these gifts he has given us. Now there’s something that’s difficult about a sermon like this in a room like this, because there’s such a myriad of different circumstances represented in these chairs. For some of you, your kids are gone, and maybe they’re not following the Lord. For some of you, there’s a lot of regret centered around your parenting. Your kids are still in the home, and you’ve done a lot wrong, and you would say, “All of the things you listed, I’m not currently doing those things very well,” so there’s a lot of regret, a lot of guilt, a lot of shame. Others of you desperately want kids and, for whatever reason, it hasn’t happened yet. You’ve struggled with infertility. You’ve struggled to have children. In light of that, let’s not miss this point. The gift is always intended to point back to the giver. God gives children to draw attention to who he is, his character, his nature, the way he relates to us. Whether you have children or not, you have a Father. Whether your earthly father is a good dude or a bad dude, your heavenly Father is perfectly righteous and full of love and grace and compassion for you. Maybe you don’t have kids or you’re struggling to have kids, but you are a child. In Matthew, chapter 7, Jesus uses this illustration, where he says, “What father, whose son asks for a piece of bread, would give him a stone?” Jesus’ conclusion to that is, “If you, being evil, can give good gifts, how much more will your Father take care of you in heaven?” If God is perfect, how much better will he do at parenting us, comforting us, leading us, loving us, than we who are evil even do loving our kids? So if you’re in here and you’re hurting, what father in here, whose child was all alone hurting, would leave them in isolation versus going and comforting them? How much more will God comfort you in your time of hurt, be with you in your time of need? He might not give you the answers, but he will give you himself, which is better. Then of you who might be riddled with regret, riddled with guilt and shame, what earthly father would want their child beating themselves up over past mistakes? How much more would your heavenly Father delight in coming and showing grace and mercy to you and reminding you that Jesus paid it all? As a good heavenly Father, he would come in and remind you, “Don’t carry a weight that has already been lifted, and don’t try to pay a debt that has already been canceled.” He loves you. You’re forgiven. Walk in the freedom your heavenly Father has purchased for you at the death of his own Son, because he loves you. Then for us as parents, knowing that’s God’s heart and knowing our hope is to model God’s heart for our children, may we remember that they are gifts to us and may we demonstrate our love for the Lord with heart, soul, and might in everyday life, keeping in mind that our time with them is very brief because the years are short. Let’s pray. Jesus, we love you. We thank you for your goodness and your grace, your mercy in our lives. You are a good Father. For the boy or girl, man or woman, struggling to believe that, I pray you would overwhelm them with the truth of who you are, your character, your love, your grace. For the mom or dad who would feel like things aren’t going very well and they need direction, I pray you would overwhelm them with forgiveness, that you will meet them in that place, God, not to shame them, but to shape them. Thank you for all of these boys and girls, God, just the joy of life, just the gift they are to their families and to this church. We love you, amen."
6,from heart to home,1,"Good morning. Are you doing okay? Good. All right, my name is Josh Patterson. I’m one of the pastors here on staff. Just about every month I teach in Kids’ Village and have for the last 11 years. Every time I get up, I say to the kiddos, “Hey guys, let’s say thank you…” So kids, I need you to do this. Can you say, “Thank you, Mr. Bleecker”? He could barely hear you. You have to say it louder than that. Say it again. Okay, parents, adults, after the service, Michael has told me he would like for you to say that to him after every time he… So can you just say, “Thank you, Mr. Bleecker”? I really do love teaching in Kids’ Village. Every time I’m in there, I have this thing I do with the kids where I try to make sure they’re with me. I’ll say, “Hey, I’m going to ask you a question, and if I ask you a question, I need you to respond a certain way.” I say, “If I ask you this question, there’s only one way that you respond. You lift up your hand like this and say, ’Cha-ching.’” Let’s practice that, okay? If I say, “Are you with me?” you go, “Cha-ching.” Kids first. Are you with me? Cha-ching! Great. Now parents, adults, everybody else ready? Are you with me? Cha-ching. Okay, now I am going to need a little bit of help. I’m going to ask questions. I’m going to do this one a little bit differently than I may do on a typical Sunday. I’m going to engage you. The hope is you will help me. So are you with me? Cha-ching! Here we go. I am unashamedly a sports fan. I grew up a sports fan. Sports were a big part of my family growing up. I grew up in Dallas, so I’m a Dallas sports fan. I love the Mavericks, I love the Rangers, I love the Stars, and I love the Dallas Cowboys. I have my entire life. I respect you if you grew up in another city and you’re a fan of the teams of that city. I’m not quite sure what to do with people who are fans of teams because of their colors or because of their mascots or things like that. I get really confused with all of that. If you grew up in the Boston area, I expect you to cheer for the Red Sox. I expect you to love the Patriots, and I can respect that. So part of what I’m doing as I’m a sports fan… I’m teaching my little ones to love Dallas sports, and I’m teaching them and really training them, specifically with the Cowboys, to know what it means to have the privilege to cheer for America’s greatest football team. It’s just a part of what we do in our home. Let me tell you what this looks like. We watch the games together. We sit down on Sundays. I arrange things around Sunday. Like a noon kickoff is so awful, because noon is nine minutes from now, so I feel that, but a 3:00 game is great. We will arrange the day, and we’ll sit there and watch. I’m answering questions. I’m dialoguing. We’re talking about players. I mean, this is what we do. I love this team. I talk about the glory days that were then, and the year… This is our year. I’m thinking. I’m always hoping. I’m in. I’m ready. Can I get an amen? They know Dez caught that ball. They know that. At the end of the season we had this question, because in my house, part of loving the Cowboys means there are teams we don’t love. You’re not allowed to be a fan of the Eagles. You can’t cheer for the Redskins. You can’t love the Giants. The Chiefs? Who cares? They’re a non-factor, but there are certain teams we just can’t root for. When DeMarco Murray got traded to the Eagles, there were questions the kids had. “What do we do? How do we respond in this situation?” I responded like any father would. “Here’s what we do. We respect the man. He played great for us, and we respect him. We wish him the best in all of life, and we pray that his team is awful.” That’s what we do. That’s how we reconcile this. I don’t see what the issue is. Let me just say this. You transmit what you treasure. You pass on your passions. I see this with my in-laws who are massive Baylor fans. They went to Baylor. My wife went to Baylor. Her grandparents went to Baylor. Her brother and her sister went to Baylor. Her cousins went to Baylor. You went to Baylor. They teach the kids, “Put your hand on your knee like this. Then you bring it up and do the Sic ’Em.” They get them the clothes. They take them to games. They do Homecoming. They are Baylor fans. There’s just this something. Again, as a dad, I told the kids, “Hey, here’s the deal. If you can’t get into A&M, Baylor is a fine choice. You can go there, and I wouldn’t be terribly upset about that. That’s fine.” That’s just kind of how we live with these things. But you transmit what you treasure. They love it. It’s fun for them. They’re passionate about it, and they’re giving this to the kids. It’s this good, healthy kind of environment. The reality is we’re all doing this. It may not have anything to do with sports or colleges. It may have to do with a craft or music or a hobby or gardening or cars or hunting or fishing or electronics or kind of tinkering and building. You are passing on something. You just are. Everybody is. We transmit what we treasure. We pass on what we’re passionate about. This is not just for a parent but for Christians. The reality is there are no neutral parties out there. Everybody has an agenda. I’ve heard parents say, “I just want to back up. I don’t want to really push anything on my kids.” My response would be, “You’re the only one who doesn’t want to push something on your kids.” I don’t care what school they go to, a private school or public school, they’re pushing something on your kids. Media is pushing something on you and me and our children. Entertainment is pushing something on you and me and our families. Everybody is pushing something, so to stand back and pretend it’s neutral is to walk in a sense of denial and foolishness. That’s why the Lord Jesus says in Matthew, chapter 28, “Hey, here’s what I want my people to be about. My people are to be about taking this gospel message to the nations, teaching them to observe all that I’ve commanded you.” We are to be diligent about making disciples. We too have an agenda. We too have something we’re to bring to the table, namely the glory and the gospel of Jesus Christ. It’s not that Baylor or A&M or sports or Cowboys… Those aren’t bad things. They just have a pecking order. They’re just not the main things. If you have a Bible, grab it and turn to Deuteronomy, chapter 6. Moses is going to lay out a pecking order for prioritization. You can be an absolute fanatic about hunting and want to take your kids there with you. You can be passionate about cars and about gardening. You can be passionate about whatever it is, and that is good and right and fine, but there’s a pecking order of priority, and Moses is going to lay that out. Deuteronomy 6. We’re going to start in verse 4. “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.” Let me give you the key point. We do this in Kids’ Village. Here’s the key point for the message: the formation of a Christian home is the fruit of a Christian heart. Now in Kids’ Village, I have the kids help us. So we’re going to repeat that. Kids, here’s what I need you to do. You’re going to say it with me. Ready? Kiddos, let’s go. “The formation of a Christian home is the fruit of a Christian heart.” Now we’re going to get a little bit louder. We’re going to divide the room. You guys, this side, are going to yell, “The formation of a Christian home…” You guys are going to try to yell louder. “…is the fruit of a Christian heart.” Are you ready? “The formation of a Christian home is the fruit of a Christian heart.” Y’all want to try that again? Because they beat y’all on that one. Here we go. Ready, go! “The formation of a Christian home is the fruit of a Christian heart.” Unbelievable. That was a tie. The formation of a Christian home is the fruit of a Christian heart. We’re going to talk about this. Right out of the gate, Moses says, “Hear, O Israel.” The word hear is the Hebrew word shema. Do you know what shema means? It means hear. So it’s called the Shema. The shema means hear. Moses is saying, “Hear, O Israel.” It carries this idea of, “Obey. Take hold of this. Look at this. Grab it. Heed this. You have to get this.” Who? Israel, everybody, the people of God. “Hear, O Israel.” What Moses is going to write about here is he’s going to reveal who God is. In fact, God is revealing who he is through Moses. He says, “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.” Now this statement basically is the summary of the law. This statement carries the essence of who God is. This idea that the Lord our God is one means the Lord is unique. There is no one like him. He is different. He is set apart. There are no other gods like this one God. When Moses is writing this, he’s writing into a context and into a culture where there are all of these false religions and false gods, and these false religions and false gods competed against each other, and the people didn’t know, “Is this god happy? Is that god happy? How do I please this god? How do I please that god?” There was all of this confusion. It was called polytheism, meaning multiple gods. So they weren’t quite sure what was going on. Then here comes the Lord, and he reveals who he is. The God of Israel, Yahweh, says, “The Lord is one.” He’s unique. He’s different. He’s set apart. He’s all-sufficient, which means he can do anything. He’s all-powerful. All of a sudden, the God of Israel stands up and is presented as completely unique. Listen to this quote from Matthew Henry. He says, “It is better to have one fountain than a thousand cisterns; one all-sufficient God than a thousand insufficient [ones].” “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.” So God has been revealed in verse 4, and this God is unique and powerful and mighty. Then Moses says, “This is how we’re to respond” in verses 5-6. He gives a command, and it’s an interesting command. The command in verse 5 is, “You shall love the Lord your God…” This God, this unique God, this all-sufficient God, this God who has revealed himself. You don’t have to wonder what he’s like. He’s telling us what he’s like. “You shall love this God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all of your might.” Let me ask you a question. Have you ever heard that verse before? Have you ever heard that verse in the New Testament? Who said that? Jesus said it. Jesus picks up this verse from the Shema. He goes back into the Old Testament and picks it up and brings it all the way over here into the New Testament. Somebody asks him, “Hey, what’s the greatest commandment?” and Jesus says, “The greatest commandment is this: that you should love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.” He says it in Matthew, in Mark, and in Luke. All of those writers pick this up. What we see here is that this phrase, this command, isn’t something that’s just for the Old Testament, but Jesus brings it into the New and says that all of our life, all of our essence, all of our expression, all of our intellect, all of our strength, all of our will is to be focused toward this one all-sufficient, almighty, all-powerful, all-glorious, all good, wise, and loving God. That’s what we’re to be about. “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all of your strength.” Then in verse 6 he lays it out a little bit more. He says, “These things…” What things? The things we’ve just been talking about. “They shall be on your heart.” Before Moses ever gets to activity, before he ever gets to things we’re to be busy about doing, Moses starts talking about affection. Before he moves to activity, he begins with affection. This has to be on your heart. Parents, before you ever spiritually lead in your home, you have to have the gospel rooted in your heart. It starts with this confession personally. Is it down in the depths of who I am that the Lord our God is one, that he is unique, set apart, mighty, wise, generous, good, and loving? Has that taken root in my heart? Has that reality hit my heart and taken up residence there? Because that’s where Moses says it has to start. Again, before we’re ever investing in those in our homes, there has to be a deposit in our hearts. So the first question I would pose to any of us and all of us is…Has the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ taken up root or residence in your heart? Do you love him? Do you have affection for him? Not some kind of weird affection, but an affection of “I am moved by this one who has laid down his life for me. Because I’ve been purchased and bought with a price, I can live for no other.” Has that washed over you? Has it washed over me? So we see that God is revealed. Then Moses says this is our response. So the question is…How do we do that? How do we love the Lord our God with all of our heart, soul, mind, and strength? How do we make sure these words have taken up residence in our hearts, as verse 6 says? Moses is going to say in verses 7-9. The outworking of verses 5-6 play out in verses 7-9. They play out through regular and routine reinforcement. Essentially, what Moses is saying is, “I’m continuously and constantly preaching the gospel to myself and to others.” Peter is saying the same thing as he writes his epistle. He says, “Hey, brothers and sisters, look up. You have to be reminded of this gospel you know and love.” We have to be reminded of this gospel we know and love. It’s not just something that I walk down an aisle at age 5, 6, 7, or 8, shake a hand, say a prayer, and I’m good to go for the rest of my life. You and I are driven to drift. Who has ever been to the beach? Raise your hand if you’ve been to the beach. Okay, have you ever been out in the ocean? Get your hand up if you’ve ever been out in the ocean. Did you have a good time when you were out in the ocean? Is it awesome? Have you ever been out in the ocean and been playing and hanging out, and all of a sudden you look up and realize your parents are over there and you’ve kind of drifted down this way a little bit? And your parents are like, “Get back over here!” You swim back over there, and you’re in line with where they want you to be. You’re kind of hanging out and playing, and then what happens? You look up, and you’ve drifted. That is the Christian life. You and I will drift. It’s a part of who we are in the broken reality of our hearts. So you and I have to swim against this drift. How? Through regular and routine reinforcements, that we’re continuously and constantly preaching the gospel to ourselves and others. You see what Moses says here in verse 7: “You shall teach your children diligently.” It’s interesting as he’s talking about the passing on of the confession. What confession? The Shema. “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.” This confession is to be passed on and reinforced parent to child. It’s not the job of the priest or the pastor. It’s not the job of the church, primarily. It’s the job of the family unit, whatever that unit looks like, to then commend this confession to the next generation. He says, “You shall teach them diligently.” The word there carries this idea of over and over and over again. It’s constant. It’s continuous. It’s repetitive. It’s routine. It’s regular. It’s what we do. You see that, because he’s going to outline some things. Look at what he says in verse 7. “You shall teach them diligently. You shall talk of them when you sit and when you walk, when you lie down, and when you rise.” It’s this idea of wherever you go and whatever you do, this is what you’re to be about. The Cowboys are awesome, and Baylor is okay, and you have all of these other things, but what you’re doing in the pecking order is this is primary. This is the umbrella under which everything else falls. The imagery that comes to mind as Moses writes this is one of a sculptor, one who’s an engraver. He or she has a stone or a marble and is etching into that stone and bringing shape to it, creating detail and getting in and working into that stone. Here’s the reality for one who’s an engraver or a sculptor. This is not occurring through happenstance. You don’t just walk by it and this thing gets engraved. It doesn’t just happen as you go. There’s intentionality in what Moses is talking about here. There’s purpose and design. There’s focus and attention. It’s not whimsical. It’s not done on the fly. What Moses is saying is there is a concerted effort and a consideration of what I am trying to shape and invest. It also carries the idea of permanence, that by God’s grace you hope that what you are investing in this little heart, this little life, continues. You hope it sticks and stays. Moses is going to use opposite terms to describe the totality of what he’s talking about here. He’s going to talk about sitting and walking, which is the idea of when you’re inactive, when you’re just hanging out, and then when you’re active, when you’re going about. When you’re inactive and you’re active. What Moses is really saying is all the time, whatever you do. Then he’s going to say when you sleep… So you’re out. You’re lying down. You’re asleep. And when you rise. It carries the idea of both at night and during the day, which is all the time. The gospel should be at the center of one’s life and one’s labor. Now I think there are some things to note in this. What Moses is talking about is not occurring at the synagogue or at the temple. This is not happening on the Sabbath day. If you take that and bring it into our context, what Moses is talking about is not necessarily what’s happening here. It’s what’s happening on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday and so on and so forth, which means it’s not just Matt McCauley and Derrick Campbell; it’s you. That Matt and Derrick would be an echo of what’s happening in your homes and in your workplaces and in your environment. It is a privilege and an unbelievable opportunity the church has as we gather on a weekend, but this can’t be it. What Moses is saying is it’s day in and day out. You know this. It doesn’t necessarily have to do with parenting. It can be you investing in someone else in a discipleship relationship. You’re longing to see Christ formed in another person. It is a continuous kind of thing. It is time together, investing in them. The unique opportunity for a parent has to do with proximity. Just look right there. They’re right there. Sometimes they’re right here and right here. What I want to do is I just want to walk through what I hope are practical and helpful ideas for how we, primarily as parents (and I’ll speak to the rest of us in a little bit), can invest in the next generation. Let me say this. If you don’t have kids, you’re a young professional, young single, young marrieds without kids, empty nesters, your kids are grown and gone… If you’re a member of this church, my hope would be that you would sense the weight and the angst of the investment you have in the next generation of this church. Why? Because we’re a family. So that you would care about my little ones because they’re a part of this covenant community and that I would care about your little ones as well, that we would recognize we’re in this together. Each and every week, the largest group of people who do not yet know the Lord Jesus Christ are birth through fifth grade. Every week, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds. Just about every weekend there are about 1,200 kids who come through here, most of whom don’t know the Lord. What an opportunity we have and what a desire. Think about this. Again, affections lead to activity. The gospel takes root in our hearts before it takes root in our homes. You should long for those little ones to have an awakening and come to understand who the Lord Jesus Christ is, because although they may belong to my family, we’re a part of a bigger family, the church. We all have a role to play here. Hopefully you received this on your way in. If you did, grab it, look at it, and check it out. What we have done is provide a framework for family discipleship. I’m going to reference this. I’m going to talk through this. It’s a framework for family discipleship, but the more I studied this, the more I prepared for this weekend, it’s really a framework for discipleship. If you have kids, great. This is going to be really helpful for you. If you’re in a discipleship relationship with somebody else, two grown dudes, this will work. Just heed the principles of what this is. It’s broken up into three things: time, moments, and milestones. Time is create family discipleship time. It means building intentional time into the rhythm of your family’s life for the purpose of thinking about, talking about, and living out the gospel. I want to talk about some ideas, things you can do, just get right on-the-ground practical. If it’s helpful, great. If you have better ideas, send them to me. I want to know. I want to learn. We need each other. Most of these ideas I have hijacked from somebody else. Time. You’re looking at the landscape of your life and considering, “If I don’t put it in this slot, if I don’t make a concerted effort, it’s not going to happen. Everybody I know is busy. I have to put this here or I’ll just simply drift and it won’t happen.” Let me tell you some really unique times I think you can leverage. First, bedtime. Bedtime at my house… I have four kids: 9, 6, 4, and 2. Most nights I look at Natalie and she looks at me. The number one goal for the night is to get the kids asleep. That’s it. By any means necessary. It’s challenging. It can be frustrating, but there’s something really unique about that time. What we try to do… This is probably our most consistent time. We can read. We can just lie there and read with them. We use The Jesus Storybook Bible. The older ones are reading something else. If you don’t have one, we have one for you. Go get one, and just read it to them. Open it up. It takes five minutes. You’ll learn something. I learn something. They learn something. We can pray together. Let me say this. How amazing it is for your little ones to hear you pray for them, just to bless them. “Lord, thank you for this little one. Thank you for little Johnny. I love him so much. I thank you for creating him. I thank you for giving him to our family. I pray that you do a great work in his life. In Jesus’ name, amen.” You don’t have to be a professional pray-er. There’s no such thing. Just pray for them. Pray with them. Ask them, “Hey buddy, how can I pray for you? Sweet girl, how can I pray for you? Any way I can pray for you today, tonight, tomorrow?” My son has a standard prayer. “Help Papa run better…” Because he got a knee replacement. “Hope I get a popsicle, and pray against nightmares.” Great. We’re going to do that. Then we’re going to wake up in the morning. “Papa still can’t run, but hey, you didn’t have a nightmare. Praise God.” We can celebrate this. You can pray. You can sing. You can read together. You can use bedtime. How about mealtime? You may not have many meals together as a family. Why not set aside a night? Why not just pick a time? Or anytime that you do have a meal, what if you did something like this? I have a friend who does this. He takes last year’s Christmas cards. They keep them in a shoebox. Anytime they have a meal together as a family, they get the shoebox out and pull out a card. “Hey, here’s the Hughes family. We’re going to pray for the Hughes today. Remember these guys. This is where they are. This is what they’re doing. This is why we love them. This is how we connected with them. Let’s pray for them.” They just work their way through the cards. Just teaching the kids. An opportunity to come around a family, to bless another family. It’s a simple idea. It’s easy. Well, it may not always be easy. It can be challenging. I get it. Family night. Pick a night. Do pizza night. Do a movie night. Just do a night where you can get together. Fight for these things. Every single weekend, The Village provides you with resources for your kids. You can pick them up by any one of the classrooms on your way out or Thursday you get the campus email. In that campus email are resources for Little Village, Kids’ Village, middle school, and high school. Why not leverage the ride home from church? Why not just ask them questions? You can ask them the questions that are written there. The answers are also written there. You can ask. They can answer. You can have a discussion. Leverage that time. Why not? It’s a time. Use that time. Here’s another idea. I have four kids. I was just trying to figure out, “How am I going to get time with each one of these kids?” and somebody said, “What if on the day they were born…? Lily was born on the twenty-eighth. Luke was born on the eleventh. Liv was born on the sixth. Lucy was born on the eighth. What if on the sixth, eighth, eleventh, and twenty-eighth you just did something special and unique with one of those kids? What if on the sixth you took Liv to doughnuts or you wrote her a note or you just did something that let her know, ’I’m thinking about you, baby, on this day. This day I’m thinking about you in a unique way. I think about you all the time, but on the sixth, hey, it’s you and me today, girl. Or it’s you and Mom today.’” That we would use that time to speak into them with good gospel truth. It’s just trying to create energy. Really, it’s just the impetus to start. There are times when I stand back here and I just feel overwhelmed. I don’t know what to do. Here’s what prayer looks like at our house around the dinner table. “Hey, let me pray. I’m going to pray for the meal. Stop eating. Stop eating! Put your fork down. I just want to pray for the meal. Would you put your fork down? Close your eyes.” “Dad, you close your eyes.” “You close your eyes. Close your mouth. Dear God… Get off the table!” That’s what it’s like. “God, thank you for this meal. Help these kids be obedient. We’ve got to get to bed, amen.” It’s a hustle. It is a total hustle, but pick a time and do it. Moments. Here’s what moments are all about: capturing and leveraging opportunities in the course of everyday life for the purpose of gospel-centered conversations. Let me give you four things I think you can leverage. I think you can leverage technology, discipline, your home, and the car. There are a billion more. Let me walk through these. Technology. How many of your kids love to play on your phone or your iPad or the computer? Not all of your kids love that? Great job. Send me an email about how you got to that point. What I want to do, as my kids long for technology, is to take that longing and redirect it toward a gospel purpose. Let me tell you a couple of things, just ideas. Again, I’m picking these up from anybody I can. There’s an app called New City Catechism. Just get it. Ignore me right now and download the app. It’s written by The Gospel Coalition. Tim Keller had a huge hand in this. It’s really helpful. It’s really good. It’s 52 questions you walk through as a family. You will learn something. I’ve learned something. My kids learn something. And you know what? When they say, “Hey, Dad, can I play Angry Birds?” I say, “No, but you can look at New City Catechism. Okay, great. Here, play it. Look at it. Read it. Learn.” Scripture Typer. It’s an app. Download it. I think it’s free. If it’s not, it’s worth the money. It’s just a Scripture memorization app. It’s what I use. When my kid says, “Hey, can I play the Lego deal?” I say, “No, but you can do Scripture Typer.” “Okay.” So he takes my phone, and he’s in. He thinks he’s playing a game, but he’s memorizing Scripture. I’m taking a longing and redirecting it toward a good gospel work. You can leverage technology. I have a friend who uses a deal called Operation World. Operation World is an organization that looks at literally every country across the globe and considers what the impact of the gospel is in that country. So take a country, Myanmar. It’s a closed country. “Here’s what they believe. Here’s where the impact of the gospel is. Here’s how you can pray for that particular nation.” He just puts it up on Apple TV, AirPlays it right onto the screen, they watch a three- or four-minute video about this particular country, and then they pray. It’s five minutes, but do you know what just happened? They just put on their God goggles, and they got to look through this and see, “Oh my goodness. God is working in a billion different places that I’m unaware of. Here’s a way I can engage and pray.” Their little worldview is expanding a little bit, and guess who else’s worldview is as well? Yours, mine. They’re just leveraging technology. You can leverage discipline. Anybody ever have to discipline their kids? Okay, eight of you. Thank you. Again, email me about how you’re doing this. Discipline is a literal every single day opportunity, but it’s an opportunity we can leverage for the gospel. I’ll say this. Most times my flesh is so incited I’ll miss an opportunity. It’s just reality. But if I’m walking in the Spirit and I have this opportunity… “Why did you punch her? I’m going to take you into the other room.” Here’s how you can leverage it. Thirty seconds. “Hey buddy, let’s sit down and talk. What’s going on?” “Well, she did this.” You know, all of that. “Okay, what’s going on in your heart?” “Well, this is how it felt. This is what happened.” “Okay, what does God say about your heart?” “He says my heart is dirty and is broken.” “That’s right. But what did God do for dirty and broken hearts?” “He sent his Son.” “Yeah, he sent his Son. What did he send his Son to do?” “He sent his Son to die on the cross.” “That’s right. He sent his Son to die for these very things, just like Dad’s heart is broken, Mom’s heart is definitely broken, and your sisters’ hearts are broken. God sends his Son to die for broken people. Isn’t this amazing?” “Yeah.” “So what do we do in light of that?” “Tell him we’re sorry.” “Yes, tell him you’re sorry.” “God, I’m sorry for hitting my sister.” “Great, now you get to go tell your sister you’re sorry.” “Liv, I’m sorry for punching you. Will you forgive me?” “Yes, I forgive you.” Great. You’ve walked through gospel repentance and reconciliation. Is it hard? Absolutely. Most of the time I’m like, “How dare you hit your sister? What are you thinking?” Then it looks like this: “Daddy has a broken heart, and I’m sorry for the way I acted and the way I responded. Will you forgive me? As much as I’m putting on you, buddy, this gospel truth, Dad is in the same boat. I need the same Savior I’m pointing you toward.” You can leverage discipline, the discipline the Lord presses on your heart and the discipline you’re pressing on your little ones’ hearts. Leveraging the home. I have a friend who put up a chalkboard in his garage. As they drive in or drive out, he or she or the kids are always writing notes to each other. “Praying for you today as you have the big test.” Or writing a Scripture up there or “Think you’re awesome.” All of these little gospel glimpses and nuggets they’re using, and they’re kind of trying to outdo one another. “Hey, you did great today in baseball. So proud of you.” They drive in. “Oh man, it’s there.” It’s like, “Dad is thinking of you. Mom is thinking of you. Sister is thinking of you,” whatever it is. They’re just leveraging the home. Using music as a teaching tool. Bleecker can sing. I cannot sing. So we will play Bleecker on our phones and have Bleecker sing. We’ll just sing with Bleecker. You can have Bleecker sing in your home. He does these little memory verse things, and you can do it. You can leverage your home for the sake of the gospel, just these little moments. Just last night, at some time in the dead of the night (because I have no idea what time it is when the kids climb into the bed), Luke climbs in the bed and lays right here on me. So I have this. Natalie has all of that, which is fine. It’s my call to give her all of that in that moment. Luke says, “Had a nightmare.” “I’m sorry, buddy. Was it bad?” Actually this is not me. This is Natalie. “Yeah, it was bad.” “Well, let me just remind you that it’s a lie. It was not real, and you know what? No matter how big your fears are, God is bigger.” Then at 3:00 in the morning…I don’t know what time…she just prayed for him. It’s seizing a moment, an opportunity to speak truth into a little one’s heart. It just pops up. Now let me say this as a parent. When these opportunities pop up, seize them. Be ready for them. That means we have to kind of sharpen our game, in a sense, which is good and right, and all of us need to do that. There’s no shame in needing to sharpen up your game. Let’s just sharpen it up, and let’s go. Let’s get after this. Milestones looks like this. Parents mark and make occasions to celebrate and commemorate significant spiritual milestones of God’s work in the life of the family and of the child. Ideas. Salvation. If you have a little one who comes to faith, you need to mark that. You need to celebrate that. If you have a neighbor, a friend, a coworker, a cousin, an uncle, a dad, a grandparent who comes to faith, this needs to be celebrated in the home. A baptism needs to be celebrated. The first time they take Communion. Mark that. Use that. I have friends, grandparents, as their little ones are growing up, they have bought a Bible. Their hope is that if God would grant them years, on their 13th birthday… They’ve just been marking this Bible for their grandchild, and they’re going to give it to them at a special moment. They’ve just been underlining verses that are meaningful to Grandma and Grandpa. At some point they’re going to hand that to that little one. They’re going to be able to open it up, and there’s a legacy that’s being passed on. I’ve been a part of these things, these rites of passage, where these men will speak into this 13-year-old boy and call out something bigger in him that he knows is there, call him to live for some type of transcendent cause. These are milestone moments, these purity talks, these rites of passage, that you’re marking these things. Some of the markings and the commemoration could be around loss, the loss of a parent, the loss of a grandparent, the loss of a friend. There are plenty in our church who have suffered loss, and as that anniversary approaches, rather than covering it up and not looking at it, by God’s grace they step into it and use it as a tool to commemorate and mark God’s faithfulness and goodness and provision and care for their family, even in a time of loss. I just want to end with giving you an example from the world of golf. Most people in conversations I have with them around family discipleship in particular, but really discipleship in general, they feel ill-equipped. They don’t feel like they have the game. They’re not quite sure what they’re doing. They feel incompetent. They feel inadequate. Well, welcome to the club. Don’t we all. You know this if you’re a parent. It’s a hard gig. It’s challenging. It’s difficult. But if I look at the game of golf as an analogy, I see people who play this game and love this game who are wholly inadequate and incompetent to play the game. They just are. Like if you shoot 85 in golf, it means you’re not good. You’re just not. Par is way down lower than that, and you’re not anywhere close, but it didn’t keep you off the course. Most of us are not scratch golfers. There are very few of us who are scratch golfers. If you shoot in the high eighties… Like around the office it’s like, “I shoot in the eighties.” “That dude is amazing.” But you’re not. You’re just not. You’re very below average in the game of golf. You just are, and that’s okay. The point is you keep coming back. We keep coming back to it. Our incompetence, our inadequacy, our being ill-equipped at this particular thing does not keep us from engaging it. We engage it because we value it. I would say parenting is very similar. There are things we just feel ill-equipped to do and aren’t quite sure how to play, but the point is you step up into the tee box and you just take a swing. The hope is you’re just moving the ball down the fairway, trying to get it closer and closer to the hole. Just like in the game of golf, if you’ve played 18 holes and you hit 90 on the front nine, you took 90 shots. Mulligan after mulligan. You lost balls. You’re on your fifth sleeve. That’s okay, because you know what happens? And it happens just about every time you go out there. You have that one shot, right? You just have that one shot. It’s the one you brag about with the buddies. It’s the one you go home and tell your wife about. It’s the one where you get home and you’re like, “I got up and down for a double bogey. It was amazing. I hit it flush, right down the fairway, driver, 182 yards.” It’s that one shot. It’s that shot that keeps you coming back. It’s that one shot that draws something out of you, and you’re like, “This is what it feels like. This is what it feels like to be in rhythm, to be actually good at this.” But you’re not. The point is there are those moments with these little ones. Most of the time you’re just hacking away. You’re just trying to get the ball down the fairway. You’re just trying to keep it in play. You’re walking. You’re looking for the ball. You find it, and you line up, and you hit it again. But every once in a while, that kid will come back to you. Every once in a while, you have that little window, that little glimpse, where they say something, where they bring up something. They ask a question or they give an answer or they let you into what their little world is like, and you just go, “Oh my goodness. That’s amazing. It’s all worth it. This is what I want. This is what I long for, this right here.” So you step back up, and you think, “Hopefully I can just repeat this over and over again,” but you don’t. You take a shot, and you go and look for the ball. You find it, and you line up, and you take a shot. You’re just putting the ball in play, hopefully, and every once in a while you get that moment. You get that glimpse, and it’s beautiful and amazing. What’s different between golf and your family is one is infinitely more valuable. We’re not keeping score. We’re just trying to finish 18. I don’t care what the score is. I’m just trying to finish. So I’m going to find the ball, I’m going to line up, and I’m going to take a swing. I’m going to find the ball, I’m going to line up, and I’m going to take a swing. By God’s grace, he’ll let us into those little moments where we realize, “This is worth it. This is unbelievable. This is what I’m called to do.” I have a friend who looks at his family each and every day as a practice. He says, “From birth to 18, I have 6,570 practices with that kid.” Then he says, “By the age of 10 there are 3,650 of those practices gone.” You know this as a parent. It just blows by. If this adage isn’t true, I don’t know what is. “The days are long, but the years are short.” You look back, and you have a 10-year-old, with 3650 practices gone. You have 2,500 practices left. So seize this moment. Seize these opportunities. Seize what God has put before you. No matter where you find yourself, what age they are, seize what God has put before you, and by God’s grace let’s finish the course. Let’s pray. Father, thank you for your grace, and thank you even now that we have the opportunity to share in Communion, the opportunity to be reminded in the Lord’s Supper that you have covered us in our failures. You have covered us in our shortcomings. You have washed over us in those areas where we have blown it and missed it, and there’s not one of us in here who doesn’t have testimony after testimony of that fact. I thank you that your gospel runs deeper, runs truer, runs wider. I pray all of this in Christ’s name, amen."
7,will our families know,1,"Hey, good evening. How are you doing? In light of Family Worship Weekend, I would love to tell you a story. There was once a man named Hoshea, and Hoshea was born a slave. In fact, his entire family was born slaves. His people had been slaves for hundreds of years. Hoshea means, in Hebrew, deliverance. It means salvation. Commentators would say his name is like a prayer, like a plea for deliverance, for salvation, which to me makes so much sense. If you are a family and you’re in slavery, what are you begging for? What is your plea? What is your hope for your kid? When you are naming your son Hoshea, your hope is, “Lord, deliver him. Save him. Free him.” He’s born into slavery. He grows up a slave, and until he’s in his mid-50s, he knows nothing but slavery. Then a man comes. A man in his 80s comes to Egypt named Moses. He says to the pharaoh who has oppressed and enslaved Hoshea and his people, “Let these people go.” The pharaoh refuses. The pharaoh hardens his heart to all of their requests. So God demonstrates his power over Pharaoh and over Egypt by sending plagues, miraculous plagues, plagues that only God could do against Pharaoh, and yet Pharaoh’s heart is hardened and he refuses to let Hoshea and his people go free. Until the tenth plague. In the tenth plague, God takes every firstborn son from all of Egypt in one night. He takes their lives. In that night, the Lord who takes the lives of the firstborn passes over the Hebrews, and there’s a great grief, a great scream in Egypt. Pharaoh wakes up to find all of the firstborns dead, and he declares to the people of Israel, the Hebrews, Hoshea and his people, “Go. You’re free. Leave.” So for the first time in hundreds of years, the people of Israel are free from slavery. They gather their things, which God had told them to already pack and be ready, and they go. They make it all the way to the Red Sea, and there Pharaoh catches up with them. Pharaoh, who had changed his mind, has chased them down with his army, and there God did something miraculous again. He parts the Red Sea and lets the Israelites walk across on dry land. Then when Pharaoh and his army come in behind them, he closes the waters over them and wipes out their enemies. So now, on the other side of the Red Sea, again for the first time in hundreds of years, their enemies have been wiped out and they who have been in slavery for so long are free. It says Hoshea and his people and Moses write songs. They dance. They sing. They celebrate their freedom, their deliverance, their salvation from slavery. Somewhere in that wilderness, on the other side of the Red Sea, Moses, who knows Hoshea, meets him and changes his name. Hoshea, whose name was given to him, which meant deliverance, has his name changed to Yĕhowshuwa, which means “God is your deliverance. God is your salvation.” Commentators say it’s like Moses changed his name from a prayer and a plea for deliverance to a promise and an actualization. “You wanted deliverance and now you have it, and who gave it to you but the Lord?” “God is your deliverance. Your name will be Yĕhowshuwa.” In English we would say Joshua. And Joshua, every time they say his name, will be a reminder that God was their deliverance.  So the people of Israel, now free after hundreds of years, now singing and dancing, start to march toward the Promised Land, the land their people were promised God would give them when they were free. They make their way three days into the wilderness, and three days in, they begin to grumble and complain and look at the Lord and say, “Why did you bring us out here? We could have died more comfortably in slavery in Egypt.” Three days. In three days, they overlook the parting of the Red Sea, the miraculous plagues, the amazing things God did. It took them three days to forget what their God was capable of and instead focus inward on themselves and go, “I am thirsty,” as if the Lord could not provide water, God who parted the Red Sea. I’d like to say three days is a long time, but I know for me how quickly I forget what God has done, how big God is when I’m faced with a circumstance that is this close to me. When I’m in the midst of something, when I am so close to a struggle, when I’m experiencing any level of discomfort, it’s like I’m blinded to anything God has ever done and how big he truly is. If I were to take a second and remind myself or have my friends who know the Lord remind me who God is, how big he is, how near he is, how close he is, and how capable he is, but I get so close to my circumstances, so fixated on myself that I forget. For the people of Israel, it took three days to forget that they follow the God who parts the Red Sea. God did provide water for them in the wilderness and he did provide food for them in the wilderness. They marched from there, and they headed to another place where they could get water, where they could get sustenance. On the way, Scripture tells us, they were attacked by a people called the Amalekites, the descendants of Amalek, who was a descendant of Esau. He attacked them, Scripture says, from the rear. He didn’t attack them head on. It says that as they were marching, he attacked the rear. In other words, the Scripture says those who were lagging behind, the slowest, the weakest of their people, that’s where Amalek attacked. Moses takes Joshua and says, “Joshua, raise up for us an army. Choose from the people of Israel someone to fight for us.” So for the first time in hundreds of years, Joshua raises up an army for Israel, who’s now free. They go out to attack their enemies, the Amalekites. Joshua leads them out into this attack, and Moses says, “I will be up on this hill. I will be beseeching the Lord for Israel.” He’s going up there to raise his hands to the Lord. Scripture tells us that as long as his arms were raised to God, Israel was experiencing victory in the battle. As long as he was beseeching the Lord, praying to the Lord, they would have victory. But anytime he began to get weary, anytime his arms drooped, the Amalekites would begin to win the battle. This was not some kind of crazy magic trick Moses was doing with a stick. This is another reminder in a long string of reminders that the victory they would have, any victory they would have, would come from God and beseeching God. Not here, not their own strength, not the wisdom of Joshua or Moses, but only in the God who they were beseeching. Moses stood on that hill, lifting his arms, to the point that he was so exhausted he could no longer hold his arms up, so he was joined by his brother Aaron and this man Hur, who held his arms up, who sat him on a stone so he could keep praying on behalf of the people of Israel until eventually they had complete victory over the Amalekites. Then the Lord’s voice comes to Moses and says two things. The Lord says to Moses, “Write this in a book.” In other words, “Don’t forget this. Don’t move on from this without recording this,” because otherwise we will so quickly forget. “Write it down so you can tell future generations. Write it down so you don’t forget the victory comes in beseeching the Lord. The victory comes in prayer.” Then he says a second thing. He says, “And recite these things in the ears of Joshua. Repeat them over and over again to Joshua, who will one day lead these people, to Joshua, who might quickly think it was him who had the victory, to Joshua, the man you’re investing your life in. Remind him over and over again how good the Lord is, how near he is, how capable he is.” I know as a pastor I deal with my own struggles. I deal with other people’s struggles. We counsel, we pastor, and sometimes I’m devastated by our lack of understanding how near God is and how victory comes in beseeching him. How many couples come and their marriage is on fire, and if the question was, “How much time have you spent in prayer about your marriage?” it’s a devastating answer. What we seek as people are easy answers, good advice, a person to solve it. “I’m single. I’m lonely. If I just met the right person, that would fix so much of my life.” When the Lord has said, “Write it down. Don’t forget. Recite it in one another’s ears. Don’t forget.” Victory comes in beseeching the Lord. The Lord is trustworthy. He can be trusted. Even in the midst of the circumstances that seem so overwhelming right now, he can be trusted. Why? I’ve seen him do incredible things. The victory is not here in what I’m capable of. The victory is in him. So we lean into him. We’re called to recite these things to one another, because without that, so quickly we forget. I get so caught up in me that I miss it, that I won’t communicate, that I won’t share it. Soon after that attack, they made it to the base of the mountain, Mount Sinai. At the base of Mount Sinai, it says Moses and his brother Aaron and 70 of the elders went up onto the side of the mountain, Joshua with them. It says there they saw the presence of God, and it says there they ate and drank. They sat in the presence of God and ate and drank. Then a voice came from the mountain and said, “Moses, come up higher.” So Moses turned to the elders and said, “You wait down here at the base of the mountain with the people. I will take Joshua with me, and Joshua and I will go up the mountain.” So Joshua and Moses walk up the mountain, and they’re in a mist. They’re in this mist for six days before the voice of the Lord comes again and says, “Moses, you come up even higher. Come out of the mist and into the presence of the Lord.” We know Joshua doesn’t go down the mountain to the people. He doesn’t go up with Moses, but he waits patiently on the mountain. For the rest of 40 days and 40 nights, Moses is in the presence of the Lord, Joshua is waiting, and the people of Israel are at the base of the mountain. After these 40 days and 40 nights, Moses comes out of the presence of the Lord, and he comes bearing two tablets of stone on which God has etched commandments. These are the laws, the way of life for the people of Israel who have been enslaved for hundreds of years. Now God will tell them, “This is how you will live as free men and women. These are the laws that will give you life.” He comes back and finds Joshua, and Joshua and Moses begin to walk down the mountain. Scripture says that Joshua said to Moses, “I hear something in the camp. It doesn’t sound like defeat. It doesn’t sound like grief.” He says, “It doesn’t sound like victory, but I do hear singing and dancing.” As Joshua and Moses approach the camp, they see the people of Israel singing and dancing again, but this time not about the God who helped them cross the Red Sea. This time they’re singing and dancing around a statue, around a golden calf they’ve created for themselves, and declaring, “This is the god who led us out of Egypt,” with Aaron as their leader. Aaron, who a little more than a month before that was eating and drinking in the presence of God, who saw him part the Red Sea, has made a golden calf for the people of Israel and said, “This is your god.” I’d love to say at that moment I’d be with Moses and Joshua and be disgusted, but at the same time, I know myself. I know us. How I can be swept up in worship, how I can be swept up in the Word of God, how I can be moved by the power of God through my friends who know him, and yet as soon as I walk out the door of the church can run right back to the gods I worship that are not him. The idols in my life that exist, I can go back to so quickly. Aaron, who ate in the presence of God, a little more than a month later builds a new one. I get it. My hope for us is that we would remind each other constantly who the real God is so we would not so quickly forget and run to something else, something lesser. Then they leave Mount Sinai and march to the Promised Land, to the edge of it, because this is the land they have been promised. Moses sends in 12 men, one from each tribe of the people of Israel, to go look through the land before they take everybody in. He sends in Joshua, and with Joshua he sends in a man named Caleb, who represents the tribe of Judah. We have all heard of Joshua and Caleb, because these are men we name our kids after. You probably know someone named Joshua. You probably know someone named Caleb. He sends in 10 other men, a man named Palti and a man named Shammua, men we don’t name our kids after, not because their names aren’t cute and hipster, but because they came back with a cowardly report. They did not trust in the Lord. They came back from the Promised Land, the land that would be the land of Israel, and these 10 men said, “The land is good. It’s beautiful. But the people are huge and strong. Their cities are fortified. There’s no way we can take them. They’ll destroy us.” Joshua and Caleb step in and say, “We have seen the land. The land is good. The people are big. The cities are fortified, and our God is bigger. Our God who parted the Red Sea, who provided water and food out of nothing in the wilderness, can give us victory in the land of Canaan,” the land that would become the land of Israel. The reaction of the people to Joshua and Caleb’s tale of how great God is was for them to pick up stones and say, “We should kill Joshua and Caleb.” So God said to Moses, “These people, this generation, this group from Israel, will not go into the Promised Land. They will get what they are asking for. They will die in the wilderness.” He says, “For 40 years, you will wander the wilderness, never going into the Promised Land, and during those 40 years, your entire generation will die off except for Joshua and Caleb. Joshua and Caleb will go into the Promised Land. They will lead your children, those 20 and under. I will raise them up, and they will go into the Promised Land with Joshua and Caleb. The rest of you will die.” So for 40 years they wander. Forty years later, when they get back to the Promised Land and Joshua and Caleb have watched all of the people their age die off, Caleb says, “I am just as ready today as I was 40 years ago to go in.” The book of Joshua tells us that Caleb said, “The land I want for my inheritance… I want the hill country, the land where there are fortified cities, where there are the biggest enemies. That’s the land I want, because my God is greater, and I delight in being wholeheartedly committed to him.” Caleb said, “I trust in him. That’s the land I want for my tribe.” Before they entered the Promised Land, Moses, who was told he would not go with them, stood up, gathered the people of Israel, and gave them a final speech, a final word, a repetition of the law. This is why I love the book of Deuteronomy, because what the book of Deuteronomy is is the summary of the history and the commands for the people of Israel to a new generation. Their parents did not trust the Lord to go into the Promised Land, so Moses is saying, “Because your parents messed this up, let me tell you what you should do and how you should live as you go into the Promised Land that should have been theirs.” So in Deuteronomy, he gives them three chapters of history at the beginning. “This is what we’ve been through. This is what God has done. This is how God has been trustworthy.” Then in chapter 4, verse 9, as he turns the corner from history into his speech before he goes and dies on the mountain, he says, “Only take care, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things that your eyes have seen…” Do you hear it? “Don’t forget this. Guard your soul diligently.” Then he says, “Make them known to your children and your children’s children…” He says, “Care for your own soul diligently.” Diligently means work hard at it. Don’t give up. It’s going to be hard, but be patient. Don’t forget what you’ve seen, and don’t you dare not tell your kids about it. Communicate to the next generation and the next generation and the next generation who the Lord is, what he has done, how near he is, how good he is, and how capable he is, how in beseeching him we can know him. Now I’d like to say I would be the Joshua and Caleb and Moses ready to go, that I would be the young generation who’s ready to follow them, but honestly, I get what their parents went through. I get what the spies went through going through the land and coming back. In the face of opposition, in looking at how big the opposition is, we can be easily intimidated. When we look out at the culture and what things can be said to us the church, what I look like when I say I believe the Bible, and what the world would think of that, I can cower. I can shy away. I can refrain from being bold the way the Lord has called me to in the face of opposition, because I forget who my God really is, the God who is bigger, the God who is better, God who is close, God who has called on me to beseech him. Two chapters later… Moses keeps going, and in chapter 6, verse 4, he’ll have this section we call the Shema. The Shema was part of the Jewish morning and evening prayers. It’s the verse that when someone asked Jesus Christ, “What is the most important thing in the Bible?” Jesus said this, Deuteronomy 6: “Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.” Moses says, “Impress these things on your children.” He says, “Teach these things diligently to your kids.” He says, “Talk about them when you get up. Talk about them when you walk on your way. Talk about them in your house. Talk about them outside your house. Put them on your gates. Put them on your doorposts. Put them on your forehead.” He says, “Talk about the Lord everywhere you go, whatever you do.” If you are a parent, if you are single, whatever you are, this is your call. If you are in this generation, you were telling it to other generations. You were telling it to people within your generation. “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your might.” The word he uses there is you teach it diligently. Why? Because it will not be easy, because to disciple the next generation is hard. It’s messy. To be discipled is hard and messy, because we are broken and messy people, and we are so quick to forget who the Lord is, how great the Lord is, how near he is, how capable he is. Then as Moses draws his speech to a close in chapter 32 at the end of Deuteronomy, it says this. This is right before Moses is going to go up on the mountain, bless the people, and die. It says in verse 44, “Moses came and recited all the words of [a] song in the hearing of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.” I like to imagine Joshua and Moses singing together, this 120-year-old Moses, this 80-something-year-old Joshua. I like to imagine they’re these old men singing in this beautiful perfect harmony. I don’t know what it really looked like, but that’s what I like to imagine. “And when Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel, he said to them, ’Take to heart all the words by which I am warning you today, that you may command them to your children, that they may be careful to do all the words of this law. For it is no empty word for you, but your very life, and by this word you shall live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess.’” He says, “I’m talking to you, the children of the generation who messed this up. Tell this to your children too. Be diligent after your own soul. Be diligent in teaching it to your children.” He says, “Listen. This is no empty word. This is your very life.” In other words, “Your lives depend on this.” For us today it’s no different. This is no empty word for us. The commands of the Lord on how we should live and who he is are not empty to us. It’s our very life. Our lives depend on this. Our children’s lives depend on this. Joshua, who’s born in slavery and is named later “God delivers…” All of us are born in slavery to sin. All of our children are born slaves to sin, and there is only one Deliverer. Hundreds of years later, another baby would be born, and his parents would be told, “Name him Yĕhowshuwa,” which in Hebrew we would say translates to Joshua. If you translate it to the Greek and then to English, we would say that name is Jesus. Jesus’ name means God delivers, God saves. An angel comes to his earthly father Joseph in a dream and says, “Hey, don’t divorce Mary; this baby is from the Lord,” and the angel says to Joseph in this dream, “You will name him Jesus, because he will come to save people from sin.” Jesus is named Jesus because his purpose is to deliver you from the slavery you were born into. I know for so many of us in here, all day long we drag in here the sin we are entangled in, the mess our lives are, and so many of us would pray, “God, deliver me.” I’m telling you that our only hope is in our only Deliverer, Jesus Christ, who for that purpose was named “God delivers, God saves, salvation is in God,” and for that purpose came to live, to die, and then to be resurrected again to have victory over sin, over death, over the Devil. Deliverance solely rests in Jesus Christ. For the next month, we’ll be talking about the coming of Jesus Christ, the waiting, the anticipation in the people of Israel and in the church of God, waiting for Jesus, for the Deliverer, for God to come. His name would be Immanuel, God with us. For the next month, Advent, which means the coming, the anticipation, that’s what we’ll be walking through: the coming of Jesus. Right before Moses died, he laid his hands on Joshua, and the Scripture says Joshua was filled with the Spirit of God and filled with the spirit of wisdom. Then Moses went up on the mountain to die, and Joshua led the people of Israel into the Promised Land. They defeated their enemies in the Promised Land, and they divided the land amongst the tribes, and then Judges, chapter 2, tells us Joshua died 110 years old. It says the people of Israel were faithful to God as long as Joshua was alive. Then it said all of the elders who were raised up with Joshua who led the people of Israel… As long as they were alive, the people of Israel followed God. Then it says after Joshua and the elders died, a new generation came who did not know God, who did not know what God had done. In other words, all of these commendations, all of these commandments to teach these things diligently, to care for your own soul diligently, to know what the Lord has done, to not forget, to not move on, to recite these things, to write them down and read them, were lost on a new generation who had not done that. My prayer for us is that that would never be our story, that we would not turn over to the world the education of the next generation, we would not listen to the world on who God is, but rather listen to God on who he is, that we would not quickly forget who he is, nor would we shirk our duty to communicate who he is to the next generation. Over and over again in Scripture, it says, “Communicate this not just to your own heart, but to another generation, to the children and the children and the children.” I think we underestimate two things. First, we underestimate our culture and their message. The message of our culture, the beliefs of our culture, we underestimate just how different it is from Scripture. Our culture has a different morality than our God, has a different belief system than our God, has a different authority than our God, has a different belief in sexuality than our God, has a different belief in materialism than our God, has a different belief on you as an individual and your value than God does. We treat it kind of like we all get along, like we’re all the same, but the truth is we underestimate just how different our culture is from God and what he has called us to. Secondarily, we underestimate the role you are called to play in stepping out and calling out and distinguishing the difference between the culture and the reality, in particular, distinguishing and calling that out to the next generation. All of you have been called to recite these things to one another, to encourage one another, to say to one another, “This is who God is. This is the only place where deliverance is. It’s in Jesus Christ.” All of us have been called, parents or not, to lead the next generation to know Jesus Christ and the truth he is and that that is the only place where deliverance happens: in Jesus Christ. So how do we do this? How do we disciple? I want to give you three really practical ideas, and then we’ll close out. At The Village Church, we talk about family discipleship. We talk about the framework for family discipleship. I want to give you three definitions, three pieces of that framework. 1. Family discipleship time. Family discipleship time is creating intentional time built into the rhythm of the family’s life for the purpose of thinking about, talking about, and living out the gospel. When I was single, this looked like my roommate and me saying, “Thursday night, 9:00 at the latest, let’s gather in our house, and we will talk about how we are doing. We’ll confess sin to one another. We’ll pray for each other. We’ll push each other toward the Lord.” We had a time set aside that we said, “This is when we will chase the Lord together.” Now that I’m married, Wednesday nights after the kids are in bed, my wife and I have a time we call “our hour,” where I will press my wife toward the Lord, where I’ll hear how she is doing, where we will read a book together, we will read Scripture together, we will pray for one another, we will confess sin to one another. Because if we say we’re going to do it organically, it’s a nice way of saying it will rarely happen, but if we say we will do this intentionally and set aside time to do it, it will happen, because we will hold each other accountable to it. With kids, the kids I have, the kids who are my kids’ ages… I have a 2-year-old and a 1-year-old. For them right now it looks like every night when I put them to bed, we have set aside time that before they go to sleep, I will pray over them. I will read a story from the Bible to them. Then I have a verse for each one of them that I will pray over them. For my son Oscar, who’s 2, I will say to him, “Oscar, be on the alert. Stand firm in the faith. Act like a man. Be strong, and let everything you do be done in love.” I’ll say that to him every night, because I’m being intentional in how I communicate to him who God is, how close God is, and his call in that. To my son Gus, who’s 1, he doesn’t know a word yet, but every night I will pray over him. I will say, “Be strong and show yourself a man, and keep the charge of the Lord your God to walk in all his ways.” It’s what David said to Solomon on his deathbed as he was passing on to his son the charge to keep following the Lord. I will do that every night intentionally, because it’s the call of the Lord for me to do that, and I don’t want to underestimate my call to do it. Now I can’t save my kids. Leading my kids is messy. Sometimes on like a Wednesday night, I’ll pull out my guitar and try to sing songs over my kids, songs of the Lord, and my son Oscar will scream and yell and say, “Not that song, Daddy. Not that song, Daddy.” I will keep going and I will keep pressing. Why? Because the Bible says my role is not to save my kids, but my role is to be diligent in telling these things. Diligent means I don’t give up. Diligent means I’m patient. Diligent means I don’t compromise the truth just because it might make my son uncomfortable, even if his comfort level is my singing. 2. Family discipleship moments. Family discipleship moments are capturing and leveraging opportunities in the course of everyday life for the purpose of gospel-centered conversations. This is saying whatever I’m doing, wherever I am, whatever conversation I’m having, I’m trying to leverage that opportunity to share the truth of the gospel. This week it’s raining. I’m talking to my son who’s 2 about where the rain comes from, why God would invent rain, and what the rain does, and how it’s a beautiful picture of how God cares for the earth, that he waters it. Plants grow. We eat plants. We grow. It’s beautiful. My son doesn’t quite get it, but I am leveraging that opportunity to tell him about the gospel. When times are tough, if my wife has had a hard day, I don’t just say, “I’m sorry, baby.” I commend her to the gospel. I point her to the only place where we find deliverance and the only place we have hope: Jesus Christ. For my sons, for roommates, for friends, for my wife, for my parents, my call is to leverage moments for the sake of the gospel. The easiest way I can encourage you to do that is know your Bible. Know your Bible, know who God is, know what he did, and then remind each other. Point each other to the truth of his Word. 3. Family discipleship milestones. Family discipleship milestones are marking and making occasions to celebrate and commemorate significant spiritual milestones of God’s work in the life of the family and child. Making and marking. Making means I have set it up. I’m going to plan this. This might be something like every year on my wife and my wedding anniversary, which is a milestone… We have made it another year married to one another. I will testify to my kids and to my wife how good marriage is, what marriage is, why God gave us marriage, what I hope for the next year in our marriage. It becomes a milestone for us. We don’t just celebrate us; we celebrate who God is and what God has done. Every time I have a birthday or my kids have a birthday, I want to celebrate what the Lord has done in their life this past year and point them toward my hopes for this next year. I take advantage of every milestone I can to say, “This is about remembering who God is, how close he is, how near he is, how capable he is, how big he is.” We just passed Halloween. We’re about to hit Thanksgiving. We’re about to hit Christmas. These are things that every year our culture marks and says, “Yes, this is a time we will gather as a family or we will do this as an activity.” So how will Thanksgiving this year be about the Lord, about reciting to one another the things the Lord has done? How will Christmas be a time that we recite to one another what the Lord has done? That we are another year older. Another Christmas has come. Christmas and Thanksgiving never get old, and neither does God. So every year we have another opportunity to gather our family and testify to how good God has been. You might also mark milestones, things God does in the life of someone, things like salvation. I don’t get to decide when salvation is, but my kids were born slaves to sin, and I can’t wait for the day to see them delivered from it. When that happens, I will mark that day. I will remember that day. I will celebrate the anniversary of that day, and I will call to their attention what God has done in their life every year on the anniversary of that day. That’s a milestone I mark. When my kids are baptized, when my kids get married, when my kids go from being boys to being men. Those are milestones I want to mark in their lives. For you, maybe it’s just a new job. It’s a milestone in your life, and you want to declare what the Lord has done and remind yourself. We are so quick to forget. We are so quick to wander. That’s why God says over and over again things that say, “Remember this. Pass this on. Remind one another.” Because we are prone not to do that. We are prone to forget. One of the things you can do tonight too… We’ve made it really easy for you. On your way out tonight in the lobby, there’s a huge stack of books that look like this. These are Advent guides. Over the next month, as we’re going through Advent, as we’re preparing for Christmas, as you’re thinking about gathering as roommates, gathering as families, gathering as Home Groups, there are family discipleship times written out in this booklet. You can grab these on your way out tonight. You can grab one for yourselves, two for… Grab as many as you want. Take them with you. Take a stack. Take a box. They’re out there tonight. You can take those with you. I want to tell you one more thing, and then I want to pray for you. Tonight when we close out worship, we’ll be singing a song, and it’s really my favorite song we do. I really love it. The chorus of it says, “I won’t go back. I can’t go back.” The people of Israel often in the wilderness said, “We would have been better off if we had just gone back to slavery.” I know the tendency in us is to still love aspects of the sin we’ve been delivered from. There are sins we still enjoy. There are aspects of things that are against God we still run to. I want to call us tonight to repent from those things, to confess those things, and say, “I won’t go back. I can’t go back. Jesus Christ, whose name means God delivers, has delivered me from them. He has saved me from them.” If you’re here tonight and you’re going, “I don’t know what that means. I don’t know what it means to be delivered or saved,” then I want to talk with you too. We’ll have pastors up here at the end of the service, and they want to talk with you about what that means to be delivered from something, to be saved. Let me pray over you. Heavenly Father, I am grateful for you. I’m grateful for the mercy you’ve given to me, shown to my family, and shown to our church. I pray that tonight in your great foreknowledge and mercy you would save, that tonight you would move in the hearts of men and women who know you, crave to know you, and want deliverance. I pray tonight, God, for Freddy who’s in the hospital struggling for life, that, God, you would reach in and save him, that you would move in his family. I pray in mercy, God, for us that we would not quickly forget that even in Communion, as you call us to do this in remembrance of you, that we would do just that, that we’d remember your Son Jesus Christ and everything that name means to us. We pray these things in his name and for his name’s sake and for the glory of his name, amen."
8,one generation to another,1,"Good morning. How are you? Good to see everybody this morning. Welcome to The Village Church. My name is Matt McCauley, and I have the joy of serving on staff here as our Children’s and Middle School Minister. It’s my favorite thing in the world to do. I’ve been doing it for about nine years now. I have the joy and the honor of walking us through the Scriptures this morning. Welcome to Family Worship Weekend, kids. I’m so glad you are in here with us. We can’t be more excited about seeing you next to your moms and dads. Really quickly, I’m married. My wife Ashley and I have been married for about three and a half years, and we have a son. His name is Wyatt. Wyatt is almost a year old, and he is such a joy. We had all intentions of taking a family picture so I could throw it up on the screen and brag about my family, but as we loaded everybody up into the car on Friday and were headed to the spot we were going to take the picture, we had a blowout. By blowout I don’t mean a tire went bad. We had another blowout. So the picture didn’t happen, but that’s my family, Ashley and little Wyatt, and we’re praying and hoping for many more kids to come. So welcome to Family Worship Weekend. This is something The Village does twice a year. We shut down our children’s ministry, and all the kiddos, first through fifth grade, are welcomed in to worship alongside their families. Why do we do that? Why do we take two times out of the year to make sure kids are in here with their parents and the rest of the congregation? Well, instead of me answering that question, I want to let David, the psalmist, answer that question. I’m going to read a verse out of Psalm 34, and I want you to hear David’s plea and cry for the generations to worship together. He says, “Oh, magnify [praise] the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together!” At the very end of the message, I’m going to come back to this verse, and I’m going to show you why I think that when David used the word together, he had in mind the generations, from the oldest to the very youngest, in the same place, in the same room, worshiping and magnifying the Lord. We’ll come back to that at the end. As we start, I want to be really transparent with you and just kind of put my cards out on the table. As I have prepared for this message and spent some time praying for myself and then praying for you, this has been my prayer. This is my hope for our time together: that as we read the Scriptures, as we look at God’s heart for the generations to worship together, he would impress upon you, parents, future parents, the necessity, the importance, of your children being with you in the congregation as we worship together. If that’s something you haven’t yet considered or don’t make somewhat of a regular practice, that after this message, you would consider making family togetherness, worship, happen on a regular basis. So let’s get everybody on the same page, because we have a lot of different people in the room. If you’re an adult who does not have a child in the room with you, first, I just want to say thank you so much for being here. You can already tell just by the flavor of worship that this service is going to feel a little bit different than it typically does, because we want to accommodate the younger kids who are with us. Here is what I would ask of you and myself, that as we worship this morning, what we have come to do, we would receive these little ones with the same spirit and in the same heart we see Jesus himself receiving children in the New Testament. In the Gospels, there’s a story about Jesus and his disciples going about their ministry, and these little kids keep running up to Christ, keep running to Jesus. They want to see him. They want to meet him. They want to touch him. They want to hear from him. The disciples see this as a distraction. They see these little kids as getting in the way of what Jesus had come to do, and Jesus rebukes them. He rebukes the disciples and says, “Don’t hinder these little ones from coming to me. Don’t prevent them from coming to me.” So this morning, as we welcome in some little ones, let us not hinder them from coming to Jesus but welcome them in and pave the path and point to the Jesus we so desperately desire them to run to. If you’re an adult and you have a little one, a child sitting next to you… Maybe this is something you haven’t done before. This is a first time for you. First, I just want to invite you all, parents, to breathe for a second. It’s going to be okay. I promise they’re not going to be a distraction. They are not going to be a disturbance. It is good and right that they are here with you sitting next to Mom, sitting next to Dad, sitting next to Grandmother, next to Grandfather. We have invited them in this morning. So if you have your “Mom Pincher” already ready to snip the back of the arm, just disarm that. It’ll be okay, I promise. I’ve spent the last 10 years teaching and speaking to middle school students, so 11- to 14-year-olds, and I promise I have seen it all from the stage, and nothing is going to faze me. I once had a middle school kid during a sermon get up out of his chair and lie down in the aisle and proceed to take a nap because he was tired. So I’ve seen it all. Trust me. They’re not going to be a bother this morning. Just enjoy the fact that they are here with you. We’re excited that you did bring them in. Now, kiddos, first, thank you for coming. I’m so glad you are here. I want to make sure I can see all of you, because you don’t quite come up as high as your parents do when you’re sitting down. So if you’re sitting on this bottom floor… The back seats are a little tricky, so I don’t want you to get hurt, but if you’re sitting on this bottom floor, I’m going to invite all of the kiddos to go ahead and stand up in your seat so I can see you. Go ahead. I’m giving you permission. Stand up in your seats. There you are. Great. Fantastic. Have you ever done that before? Have you ever stood up in a chair at church before? No? Oh yeah, let’s give them a round of applause. Stay standing. I want to talk to you for just a second. Now that I can see you, I want to make sure I can also hear you, so on the count of three, here’s what I’m going to ask you to do. When I get to three, I want you to clap as loud as you can, and then when I say, “Stop,” I want you to stop. Okay? Here we go. On the count of three, even in the back. One, two, three! And stop. That was pretty good, parents. Not bad. Okay, now that I have your attention, kiddos, I want you to look up here at me and I want you to listen. What I’m going to ask you guys to do is for the next few minutes… Here’s the deal, guys. I know you can do this. I know you can pay attention, because I’ve seen you with my own eyes sit in front of a screen, stare frozen (pun intended) for 109 minutes, and give your full undivided attention to what was on that screen. Now this morning, I’m going to ask you to listen and pay attention to what’s going on up here. I’m not going to break into any kind of song. This isn’t going to be a musical, but if I get the sense that I’m losing you for just a second, I might just have to pull out a really horrible version of “Let It Go” from my back pocket, and you don’t want that, I promise. But if that’s what I have to do, I’m going to do it. So give me your attention and worship the Lord this morning by listening and paying attention to his Word, to the Scriptures. Nod your heads if you think you can do that. Great. I believe you can. Now you guys can sit down. As everybody settles in, I want to go ahead and invite you to grab your Bibles and open up to Judges, chapter 2. That’s where we’re going to be this morning. If you’re a guest with us and you did not bring a Bible or don’t own a Bible, there should be one in the seat back in front of you. We invite you to take that Bible, follow along as we read, and then as you leave this place, if you don’t own a Bible, that is our gift to you. Take that Bible home. I encourage you to read it. It’s a best seller. It has been for a long time, so it’s definitely worth your time and attention to read. Judges, chapter 2. As you’re turning there, I want to give you some background, give you a little bit of context about what is happening in the book of Judges. If you spent any time in church as a child or growing up or in Sunday school, when we open up or say the word Judges and you think about that book, there are probably some names that are now running through your mind or some stories. You’re probably thinking about Samson, or maybe you’re thinking about Gideon or some of the other judges. Those are great narratives from this book, but all of these stories about these great judges are just pieces to a part of the whole book. They are pieces to this puzzle that makes up the book of Judges. All of these stories take place in a really particular and peculiar period of time for the people of Israel. There’s something really interesting happening in this time period as we open up the book of Judges. So I want to rewind a little bit and get us up to this point. We know from Genesis that the descendants of Abraham were promised some land by God, but then after, they find themselves in Egypt enslaved by Pharaoh. Then the Lord raises up a deliverer, and we know his name is Moses. If you’ve seen The Prince of Egypt or if you’ve read the book of Exodus, you know the great stories about Moses leading the people of Israel, the descendants of Abraham, out of Egypt. Then for 40 years, they wander in the desert, looking, searching for the Promised Land. As they get to the edge of the Promised Land, sadly, Moses, the great deliverer, and the older generation die. They don’t make it into the Promised Land. Moses and the complainers (which is a great name for a band, by the way) don’t step foot into the land God had promised them. But God raises up another great leader. God raises up Joshua to take the people into the Promised Land. Beginning with the city of Jericho, they begin to follow the commands of God and conquer city after city and remove the pagan inhabitants out of the land. God had given them the command to make the Promised Land their own and to worship him there as Yahweh. After a few of these battles and as they begin to settle into the land, sadly, Joshua dies as well. There are two important things to note that did not happen after Joshua passed. The first thing is that the 12 tribes of Israel did not complete the job the Lord had commanded. He had commanded them to clear the Promised Land of all of its pagan inhabitants, to tear down the altars to false gods and remove all of the false idols, but they don’t complete it. They don’t finish the job. Kiddos, it’s kind of like when your parents tell you to clean your room and you kind of clean your room, but you don’t really. You just take everything that was on the floor and shove it under the bed or hide it in the closet. You think you’ve completed the job, but you really haven’t. You haven’t finished what your parents told you to do, and that’s what the Israelites do in the book of Judges. They don’t complete what God had commanded and asked them to do. The second thing to note is that after Joshua passes, unlike what happened after Moses, no leader is raised up. No great national unifying figure is raised up after Joshua to unify the tribes of Israel. Now God had a plan for this. His plan is that he, God, would be their unifier, he would be their King, and that as a testimony to other nations who had a king, the nation of Israel would say, “We have a King, and his name is Yahweh, and we serve him.” So no king was appointed after Joshua died. They have a land, they have an identity, but they have no national figurehead. They have no leader to unify them, because they refuse to allow Yahweh to do that. Now I like to think of myself as somewhat of a history buff. I particularly love early American history, so the founding of our nation, the Revolutionary War, the colonial periods. As I was reading about what’s happening in Judges, I was reminded of a similar period of time the United States faced itself or saw itself in. So we’re going to do a little American history quiz for everybody in the room. Let’s see if you can remember these dates. When did the 13 colonies declare their independence from the crown? It was 1776, the birth of our nation. That’s what we mark it as. Then does anybody happen to know when the Revolutionary War ended? When did the troops finally leave New York? It was a few years later. It was 1783. Then the very next year, in 1784, the Treaty of Paris was signed, so it was officially done. Then when did we elect our first president of the United States, George Washington? Does anybody know that date? It was 1789. So in 1776 we declare our independence. We are not a part of Britain anymore. We are our own thing. The war ends in 1784, but we don’t elect a president until 1789, almost 13 years without this national unifying figure. So who was in charge? George Washington was our commander in chief. He was in charge of the army, but who was in charge? Who was unifying these 13 colonies? Well, we really had no one. There was a time period in the early development of our nation that we did not have a president. This is a similar situation the nation of Israel finds itself in in the book of Judges, but it was a lot longer of a time period. Instead of 13 years, it was almost 300 years after the death of Joshua before Saul was anointed king over Israel. Three hundred years of the 12 tribes of Israel without a king, and that’s where we are in the book of Judges. In chapter 1… I’m not going to read that, but I want to give you an idea of what’s happening there. In chapter 1, it opens up with some stories of two of the tribes conquering some of the lands, doing what God had told them to do, but they don’t complete the job. They don’t finish. They stop, and they allow the pagan inhabitants of the land to remain there. They don’t complete the command God had given them. Then we open up to chapter 2, which we’re going to read together. A fond memory I have of “big church” with my parents is that when the Word of God was read aloud, we would all, as we listened, stand. So I’m going to invite everybody to go ahead and stand up, and as I read the Word of God, let’s all listen together. Judges, chapter 2, verses 6-12, says: “When Joshua dismissed the people, the people of Israel went each to his inheritance to take possession of the land. And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the Lord had done for Israel. And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of 110 years. And they buried him within the boundaries of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash. And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord or the work that he had done for Israel. And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and served the Baals. And they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed down to them. And they provoked the Lord to anger.” You guys can go ahead and be seated. In the book of Judges, I like to think of this chapter, what we just read, as the iceberg scene from the movie Titanic. Going into that movie, you know how it’s going to end. There’s no question about the outcome of that movie, but still, as you sit and watch, you’re just waiting. You’re anticipating that moment. When the iceberg hits the ship, the ice falls onto the deck, and you know the ship is doomed. Well, in the book of Judges, what we just read is the tipping point for the nation of Israel. These passages tell us about the iceberg scene for the nation of Israel, and there are two particular verses I want us to look at that highlight that. The first one is verse 7. It says, “And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the Lord had done for Israel.” Then we skip down to verse 10. “And there arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord or the work that he had done for Israel.” Because the people of God failed to complete what he had commanded them to do, the people of God, this next generation, find themselves surrounded by other peoples who worship false gods, and their pure worship of Yahweh becomes infiltrated and mixed with the worship of these false gods, and they fail to know God or the work he has done with Israel. Sadly, for the rest of the book of Judges, this is our theme. Some commentators call it the “Canaanization” of Israel. They forsake Yahweh, and they begin to worship foreign and false, untrue gods. This is where it started. This is the genesis of that cycle. It’s a cycle. It’s a rinse and repeat for the entire book of Judges. Here’s the pattern we see. If you continue reading, you’re going to see this pattern play itself out over and over. The people do evil by serving other gods. Then Yahweh sends a nation to oppress them. Then the people cry out to Yahweh in their oppression. They look back to God. They look back to Yahweh and cry out to him. Then Yahweh hears their cries and raises up a deliverer. This is our Gideon. This is our Sampson. These judges, these deliverers, who are raised up by God. Because of them, the oppressor is defeated. Then for a season, the people have rest. But sadly, it’s only a matter of time until they fall into the same patterns, and it’s a repeat cycle over and over again for the rest of this book. Verse 10 is the genesis of it. It’s where it starts. So as we look at this verse, we have to ask ourselves a question. Who or what is to blame when the next generation fails to value and hold dear what a previous generation once did? Who’s at fault? Who’s to blame? What happened? How was it missed? I had this question running through my mind last summer. As a youth pastor, stereotypical guy, we do the mission trips. So last summer, I’m driving back with a van full of seventh- and eighth-grade boys, and during that van ride, this question came to mind. I made the mistake of giving those boys the rights to the radio. I let them DJ. Bad decision. For the next 30 minutes, my ears were bleeding from the horrible music they were playing. It just wasn’t good music. I kept thinking to myself, “Who has failed these boys? What adult or what parent failed to educate them between the good music and the bad music? That conversation must not have happened.” I could only take so much. I finally had to revoke their privileges, and for the rest of the drive home, my mission was to educate them on the difference between good music and bad music, the difference between music that will last and music that will fade and fizzle faster than you can say “One Direction,” which is all they wanted to listen to. So I started. I said, “Okay, guys. I have a question for you. I’m going to say the name of a band, and I want you to raise your hand if you have ever heard of that name or maybe one of their songs.” They said, “Okay, okay.” I said, “Okay, how many of you guys have ever heard of a band by the name of New Kids on the Block?” It was just blank stares. I mean, not a hand raised. None of the boys in the van had heard of that band. So I told them. I said, “Guys, when I was your age, so my generation, New Kids on the Block were everywhere. You could not turn a corner without hearing ’Hangin’ Tough’ or ’You Got It (The Right Stuff).’ I mean it was all over the place, everywhere. And you guys have never heard of them. It’s like they have been completely erased from the record of history.” Last night I said that, and somebody in the back over there said, “Amen” to that, which I thought was appropriate. Anyway, these kids had honestly never heard of that band. Then I said, “Okay, let’s try another one.” I said, “Raise your hand if you have ever heard of a band by the name of U2.” A lot of the hands went up. I said, “Here’s my point, guys. U2 has been around long before you were here, and they’re going to be around long after you are gone. Their music is going to last. That’s the difference between good music and not good music. It’s going to last beyond your generation.” So I spent the rest of the drive home trying to give them some good samples, and I don’t think it worked. I was hoping they would just erase all of the One Direction off their iPods, but I don’t think they did. Anyway, the question still remains…Who failed these kids? Was it the older generation’s fault for not introducing them, not educating them on good music, or was it the younger generation’s fault for just not caring or not listening or not heeding the words of their parents when it came to this topic? Well, Timothy Keller says it is always impossible to lay blame neatly when one generation fails to pass its faith on to the next one. Did the first generation fail to reach out, or did the second generation just harden their hearts? He’s going to argue that the answer is usually a little bit of both. It’s not one or the other, but it’s a little bit of both. I think this truth is evidenced in the wording of verse 10. So we’re going to zoom in even tighter, and we’re going to focus in on one particular word in verse 10. It’s a word that the writer of Judges used to describe this next generation. This is what he says about them. “And there arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord…” Now in the Hebrew, this word for did not know carries more weight and meaning than just the idea of a lack of knowledge. It wasn’t for lack of information. It’s more than that. It carries the idea that in a spiritual sense, there was a lack of belief rather than ignorance. The Bible Knowledge Commentary says it like this. I’m just going to read it. “The new generation of Israelites that grew up after their faithful fathers died was distinguished by its faithlessness to the Lord. That they knew neither the Lord nor what he had done for Israel could imply a failure of the older generation to communicate God’s acts to them. But the word ’knew’ probably has the sense of ’acknowledge,’ thus indicating unbelief rather than ignorance. They rejected both the Lord’s grace toward them and their responsibilities toward him. This led to the idolatrous practices cited in the verses that follow.” Another commentator puts it something like this: “The meaning of ’did not know’ is that the people deliberately refused to acknowledge God’s authority.” It is not simply that they were ignorant or didn’t have the right information about God, but that they were in unbelief. It was a matter of faith. It was a matter of belief, not lack of information. Now from the counsel of Scripture, we know that belief is a gift from God. It comes from him. Faith is not something parents can conjure up for themselves and give to their children. It comes from the Lord. Salvation belongs to the Lord. But I am convinced, and I think the Scriptures will tell us as well, that parenting and discipling your children and the next generation is about more than just getting the right information into their heads. It’s about more than just getting correct theology into their minds. Our desire is that they would know the Lord, not just know about him. So I’m going to take this word yada, know, and we’re going to look at a few other places that it shows up in Scriptures, particularly speaking about children. If you go a couple of books over from Judges and read in the book of 1 Samuel, you’re going to read about a man named Eli. Eli was a priest, a holy man of God, and Eli had two sons that the Scriptures mention. Their names were Hophni and Phinehas. The Scriptures give us a description of Eli’s two sons, and it’s not good. This is what it says about them. 1 Samuel 2:12 says, “Now the sons of Eli were worthless men.” Other texts translate it as scoundrels. The sons of the high priest were scoundrels, worthless men. Then look at what it says about them. “They did not know the Lord.” It’s that same word we see in Judges 2:10. They did not yada the Lord. I guarantee you these two guys knew about the Lord. They were sons of the priest. You’ve heard of PKs before, pastor’s kids? These weren’t just pastor’s kids. These were HPKs, high priest’s kids. So if anyone should know correct theology, right information about God, it was these two men. They grew up alongside their father. They watched their father make sacrifices and follow the commands and the rules and the laws of God in terms of the ordinances and the sacrifices. They saw this. They were Sunday school brats. They knew all of the right answers. But they were worthless men. They did not know the Lord. They had no regard for the holiness of God. We see this, if you continue to read, play out in their lives by the actions they do. You’re going to see them commit horrible atrocities before the Lord. Not only before the Lord, but in the house of the Lord they’re going to do some awful things, and it’s because they did not know the Lord. They knew of him, they knew about him, but they did not yada him. They did not know him. I want to contrast these two boys with another young man we read about in the book of Samuel, and his name was Samuel. We know from 1 Samuel, chapter 1, that Samuel had a mother who was a pretty common woman. Her name was Hannah. But Hannah had an uncommon faith and fervor for the Lord. She loved and knew the Lord. In the first chapter of 1 Samuel, we read about her, and it tells us she was barren. It tells us she was childless, and she desperately longed for and wanted a child. She would go to the house of the Lord, and she would pray and plead for Yahweh to give her a child. She was passionate about her prayers, so much so there’s a story about Eli, who was the priest at the time, seeing this woman praying fervently for the Lord, and Eli honestly thought she was drunk. He thought this woman had showed up at church under the influence because of the passion with which she was praying. The Scripture is going to say she was opening her mouth but no words were coming out. She was mouthing to the Lord, just passionately praying, and Eli is like, “Woman, you need to stop drinking.” Her response is, “No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the Lord.” We know the Lord hears her prayers, and he answers those prayers and gives her a child. His name is Samuel, and she raises him. In 1 Samuel 1:24-28, it says about Samuel: “And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, [some] flour, and a skin of wine, and she brought him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh. And the child was young [probably about 3 or 4]. Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli [the priest]. And she said, ’Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the Lord. For this child I prayed, and the Lord has granted me my petition that I made to him. Therefore I have lent him to the Lord. As long as he lives, he is lent to the Lord.’” Hannah handed her child back over to the Lord. From the age of about 3 or 4 on, Samuel would grow up in the house of the Lord under the training and instruction of the priest Eli, just like Eli’s two sons, but Samuel’s outcome is much, much different. We know that Samuel would come to know, to yada the Lord. First Samuel 3 says: “And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground. And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the Lord. And the Lord appeared again at Shiloh, for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the Lord.” The priesthood was supposed to extend and move from Eli to his two sons, but God stopped that because they did not know him, and the priesthood was transferred over to Samuel, the son of Hannah. So what was different about these three boys, about Samuel and about Hophni and Phinehas? We know that a lot was similar. They both grew up in the house of the Lord, learning the correct things, the right things about God, getting the right theology and the right information in their heads. That was similar, but do you know what was different about Samuel and these two boys we see in Scripture? We know that Samuel had a mother who prayed her guts out for her child before he was born, and I guarantee you to the day she died she was praying for her son. Some of those prayers I’m sure were hidden and in secret, but we know that some of those prayers, some of those petitions to the Lord, were public, and I guarantee you Samuel grew up seeing his mother pray for and about him. I don’t know if that was the thing that made the difference, but it was a piece of it. So moms, I want to encourage you. Pray for your children. Grandmothers, pray for your grandchildren. I’m convinced that one of the most powerful means of grace in the life of a child is the prayers of his or her mother, so don’t stop. Continue pleading for them before the Lord, in secret and also in ways they can see and know it and have confidence that, “My mother knows the Lord. My mother yadas the Lord. She doesn’t just know right things about him; she knows him, because I see her pray to him.” I want to keep moving, because we see this word come up again in the life of David and his son Solomon. We know a lot about David. David was the man after God’s own heart. Most of our psalms were written by this king over Israel, this king who, without a doubt, worshiped the Lord. I mean, he wrote songs, so there was no doubt this man sung to the Lord. There’s this really cool exchange in 1 Chronicles 28 between David and his son Solomon. We know from this passage that David was nearing the end of his life. He knew his time was coming, so he gathered a great assembly and had a charge to give to them. So he speaks to them. Then before he is finished, he pulls up his son, who will take the throne after he passes, and he gives this charge to Solomon in front of the entire congregation. First Chronicles 28:9: “And you, Solomon my son, know…” It’s the same word, yada. “…know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind, for the Lord searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.” In front of everyone, David says, “Solomon, know my God. As I have known him, know him. Don’t just know about him; know him.” I started thinking about the relationship between David and his son Solomon, about what we know and what we read in the Scriptures. I wonder if Solomon as a child ever witnessed or ever saw his dad, the king, worship. Did Solomon ever witness his father in the assembly praise the God who he knew, who he loved, who he worshiped, who he wrote multiple songs about? I guarantee you he did. I guarantee you Solomon witnessed his father, the king, worship God. Not only that, but there’s this really cool story about David that takes place before Solomon’s birth. He wasn’t there. He didn’t see it. But I guarantee you he heard about this story about his father. In 2 Samuel, chapter 6, there’s this story about David returning the ark back to the city of David. It was a great moment for the nation of Israel. They are bringing the ark back. There’s one particular instance where it says the caravan that was bringing it back stopped, and they began to praise and worship God. Then it says, “David danced with all of his might.” In an act of worship, we see David, the king of Israel, dancing with all of his might. Now my old man… I’ve never seen him dance. When I think about him dancing, it’s not really a pretty sight. But when I add the word danced mightily, it gets even worse. But you know what? David didn’t care. David knew God. He loved God, and he didn’t care who saw. He didn’t care who was around. He worshiped, and worshiped through dancing. He danced mightily before the Lord. We go on to read that his dancing was so embarrassing that when he gets home… One of his wives sees him coming into the city. Literally it says he was dancing and prancing. So not only dancing. Now he’s prancing. His wife sees this, and when he gets home, she has words with him. She is embarrassed. “You are the king of Israel. What are you doing making a fool out of yourself dancing like that?” Listen to David’s response. I love it. “And David said to Michal, ’It was before the Lord, who chose me above your father and above all his house, to appoint me as prince over Israel, the people of the Lord––and I will celebrate before the Lord.’” “I wasn’t dancing for you. I wasn’t dancing for anybody else. I was dancing for the Lord, and I don’t care what you think about it. And I’m the king, so I’ll just throw that in there too.” I love what he says. He continues. Basically, he goes, “You think that was bad?” “I will make myself yet more contemptible than this, and I will be abased [humiliated] in your eyes.” Basically, that translates… He goes, “You think what you saw was embarrassing? You think that was bad? I will become even more undignified than that, because it’s before the Lord. I know him, and I will worship him.” I guarantee you Solomon saw his dad worship the Lord with passion. So dads, here’s what we’re going to do. I’m going to ask you all to stand up, and then we’re going to play some music… No, I’m kidding. We’re not going to ask you to dance this morning. But I really do think this idea is why weekends like Family Worship Weekend are so important. Parents, future parents, it is vital that your children witness and see you worship the Lord with passion. Not just know about him, not just have right information in your minds about him, but with passion, whatever that looks like. If that’s raising your hands, if that’s starting every morning at the table with the Word open, if that’s bowing your heads when we’re in the corporate assembly, your kids need to see that. They need to know it. They need to witness it. I think that’s why when David chose the wording of Psalm 145, which is one of my favorite psalms… In verse 4, he words it like this. He could have said, “One generation shall teach your words to another,” but he doesn’t. He doesn’t say “teach.” He says, “One generation shall commend…” That word commend can be translated praise. “…your works to another…” So there’s more to discipleship than just teaching right information. We are to commend, we are to praise the works of the Lord to the next generation. John Piper words it like this. Speaking of this idea, he says the transmission of knowledge, the works of God, through a certain mode… He calls it a mode of praise, of exaltation. This is where you get into the difference between what you teach your children and what you are passionate about in front of your children. Here’s the deal, parents, future parents, anyone who disciples or meets with children. They’re not going to remember everything you teach them. I don’t remember everything my parents taught me, and they taught me a lot. I remember some, but I don’t remember all of it. But I remember, and your kids will remember everything they saw you getting passionate about. I’ll give you an example from my own life. I take a lot of pride in my lawn, in my yard. I want it green. I want it plush. I want it to be the best one on the street. Where did that come from? Well, when I was a child, my dad never sat me down, opened up a horticulture book, and gave me a step-by-step lesson in the history of lawn care and lawn maintenance. We didn’t do that together. But do you know what I did see growing up? I saw my dad passionate about our yard. I saw him take care of it, and I was right alongside him with it. So it just spilled over onto me. It just happened, because he was passionate about it. He cared about it. So moms, dads, what do your kids see you getting passionate about? Dads, our kids see us get passionate about a lot of things, about our favorite sports team or about our hobbies or about work. They see us get emotional about it and passionate about it. Do our kids see us get passionate about the Lord and knowing him? Moms, our kids see us getting passionate about a lot of things, passionate about our hobbies, passionate about our appearance, but do our kids see us getting passionate about the worship of the Lord? Because they need to. They need to see that happen. And it’s not just parents they need to witness and see. They need to see from the oldest to the youngest generation the praise and adoration of the Lord. That’s what did it in my life. This is what the Lord used to bring me to salvation. I grew up in church. I was a Sunday school brat. I knew all of the right answers, had all the right information about the Lord in my mind, but it took the Lord bringing me to a Bible study my senior year in high school, sitting in the back, and watching peers, people my age, worship the Lord with a passion I’d never seen before, some with hands raised, some with heads bowed, but all worshiping a God they didn’t just know about but that they “yada-ed,” a God they knew, that they believed in. The Lord used that, allowed me to see that, and opened up my eyes to the beauty of the gospel, and I began to worship Jesus and love him. In an instant it happened for me. All of that kindling my parents had put around my heart was ignited for the Lord. So I’ll close, and I promised I’d come back to this Psalm 34 and show you why I think David had in mind the generations worshiping together. If we start from the beginning, verse 1 of Psalm 34, it says, “I will bless the Lord at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul makes its boast in the Lord; let the humble hear and be glad. Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together!” Then if you skip down a few verses, David says, “Come, O children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.” So it’s good and right that our kids are in here with us this morning. Now I know that out in the foyer, out in the hall, we have the best preschool, the best children’s ministry around. Week in and week out, the kids learn the deeper things about the Lord, and they come and know to worship him through those things, but in here every week we experience the Lord, and you guys know it for yourself. He meets with us as we worship him together and as we read his Word. So let us not forsake one of those things for the other for our kids. Let them see both. As you go to check your children in to Little Village or Kids Village, I want to encourage you, parents, to check yourself in as well and serve with them, alongside them, so when that is over, you can come into this room together and together magnify the name of the Lord and worship him together, generation and generation. The generation after Joshua fell away from God, not because they lacked right understanding or information about him, but they failed to know him, to yada him. My prayer is that would not be the case for the next generation that is in our midst this morning, that as they see us, as we commend, as we praise the works of God to them, they would come to know, to yada the Lord as well. Let me pray for us. Father, I thank you for our time together this morning. I praise you that you aren’t just the God of one generation but of all, so I thank you for everyone who’s represented in this room this morning. I pray that as we have read and studied your Word, Holy Spirit, that you would teach us, that you would enlighten our hearts to the wonderful things we have seen and read, and that we would not just be hearers of the Word this morning but that we would go and do. So bless each of us from the oldest to the youngest. We love you and we thank you. We ask all of this in Jesus’ name, amen."
9,lip-synching-and-family-discipleship,1,"Good morning to you all! Turn with me in your Bibles to Deuteronomy, chapter 6. We’ll be looking at verses 1 through 9. Once you arrive at Deuteronomy, chapter 6, I invite you to stand with me in the honor of reading from God’s Word. Would you stand with me? Deuteronomy, chapter 6, verse 1. “Now this is the commandment—the statutes and the rules—that the Lord your God commanded me to teach you, that you may do them in the land to which you are going over, to possess it, that you may fear the Lord your God, you and your son and your son’s son, by keeping all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, all the days of your life, and that your days may be long.  Hear therefore, O Israel, and be careful to do them, that it may go well with you, and that you may multiply greatly, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey. Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.” As you’re being seated, let’s go to the Lord in prayer. Father, what’s really at stake when we think about family discipleship is the very message and the very fabric of the gospel that you are mighty to save. Lord, we endeavor to not lift up the family as the goal but, Lord, to lift up the gospel. Father, may you help us today to see that, to see clearly that family discipleship is about passing on the message that you’ve saved us. You’ve purchased and died for sinners. Lord, I pray to that end. It’s in Jesus’ name we pray, amen. In the 90s, there was a music group that broke onto the scene by the name of Milli Vanilli. Some of y’all are laughing because you remember them. They were cool. Some of you high school kids are rolling your eyes at me. They were cool! Their song “Girl You Know It’s True” just makes me want to break out and dance. It gained them international success and fame. They sold millions of dollars worth of copies of that one song. Their acts were made up of these huge dance routines and all this light show. It was this incredible thing that just took the world by storm, if you will. There were clothing lines. They won a Grammy. But if you remember the story behind all the business, behind all the lights, behind all the dance routine, there was a terrible deception that went on. What was it? They were guilty of lip synching, right? The very song that made them famous “Girl You Know It’s True”…their voices were not even to be found on the track. You see, after they had to give back over millions and millions of dollars worth of refunds and after they went through like 27 different lawsuits, the judge and everyone around concluded that Milli Vanilli was guilty of a gross form of fraud. You say, “What in the world does that have anything to do with Deuteronomy, chapter 6, verses 1 through 9?” Well, I think, amidst the busyness of everything that goes on sometimes in the church and all the production sometimes, I think we are guilty of a particular type of deception. That is with regard to the role of raising up our children to be the vocal men and women of God, with regard to the responsibility of discipling our children that is unequivocally an assignment that’s been given to parents. Anytime we pay someone else (a youth minister, children’s minister) to do the role that’s been assigned to us, it’s fraud. I know what you’re saying. At this point you’re going, “Are you saying we should fire Charity?” Charity is at the back going, “No. No, don’t! Don’t fire me.” Right? “Are you saying we should get rid of all youth ministers?” Well, to explain that, let me grab hold of my opening illustration and say this. If Milli Vanilli’s voices were there, if they were present, if they were the primary voices and then there were backup singers, nobody would have said anything. It would have been okay. It’s the fact that they, as the primary singers, their voices, weren’t even present on the CD. That’s the issue. Here’s the question I have for you, parents. When you think about discipling your children, are you the primary voice of discipleship in their life, or have you given that over to a coach, to a teacher? We mean as the church to come alongside you and to be back-up voices to help you, to help equip you, but the responsibility of that was given to you, parents. What I want to do for this moment is to talk with you about family discipleship. But I can’t fit family discipleship into Deuteronomy 6, or I can’t make Deuteronomy 6 only about family discipleship, meaning to read the Bible well, you also have to see it in context. Deuteronomy, chapter 6, has a context. Kids, you remember the story of Moses. God’s people are in captivity. They’re in slavery to Pharaoh in Egypt. God brings them out, and he uses Moses to do so. Then God gives Moses the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments are to be a way that God’s people and he are to relate to one another. Moses has just delivered the Ten Commandments, and now he is going to give us the purpose behind the Ten Commandments, and then he is going to preach one of them. The purpose behind the Ten Commandments comes at verse 2. “…that you may fear the Lord your God…” The purpose of the Commandments is for fear of God. If you guys keep me around long enough, I’d love to preach a sermon (I’m begging you at this point) on fear of God to walk this out further. There are several different types of ways people can fear God, and there are several different components to fear of God. We won’t go into them all, but perhaps you think of fear of God in the sense of trepidation, like what happens to Adam and Eve when they’re standing after they bit the apple. They’re standing there, and they’re afraid, shaking, if you will. That’s a form of fear of God. Perhaps you think of Moses when he is talking to the Lord in a burning bush. The Lord tells him, “Take off your sandals.” There’s a sense of reverence that accompanies the fear of God. Maybe a component of fear of God. We hear the text often. “The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.” We don’t have the time to go into all of that, but I would say this. Part of fear of God is being intimately connected with God’s omnipresence. Omnipresence and fear of God go hand-in-hand, meaning what it means to live in fear of God is to live our lives as if God is watching us. Because God is everywhere and because God sees all, he indeed is. That’s what it means. Children, what that means is Mommy, Daddy, or those sitting around you, what we want to say to you is it’s really important what we do, even when nobody is around. It still matters because God sees us. That’s what it means to fear God, a sense of paying attention, a sense of being careful, a sense of awe. When we think about fear of God, our problem is that familiarity breeds content. If I put it to you like this, a man is working at a construction site. He begins to work a bulldozer for the first time. When he first walks up to this machine, he looks at it and goes, “Man, this thing is awesome. It’s huge.” He climbs in it, and he is looking around. It’s precisely because he doesn’t understand it fully yet (he is not completely familiar with it yet) that he recognizes the power of this machine. He follows the steps. Step one, step two, step three. He has a healthy sense of fear. That’s day one. But on day 360 when he finally has an accident after he climbs in it… Because he is familiar with it, because it’s become commonplace with him, that familiarity makes him lessen the power. He is not thinking as much about how powerful. He doesn’t have a fear of how powerful this machine is and has an accident. The question then I would pose to you is…Is the machine’s power any less dangerous on day 360 than it was at day one? No. The familiarity breeds content. What I would pose to you is…Is God any less dangerous now than when he flooded the earth and bodies were floating in the water? Is God any less dangerous now than when the man puts his hand out just to steady the ark of the covenant that has God’s presence and falls down dead? Is God any less dangerous now than then? Is God any less dangerous now than when Ananias and Sapphira tried to hide sin from him, and he strikes them down dead? Is God any less dangerous now than when he was then? Is God any less dangerous now than when he broke the back of his Son and killed him because of sin? Is God any less dangerous? The answer is no. He is not. He is not to be played with. For those of us who believe in him and who have walked with him… Unbeliever, I would say this is reason for you to repent and be saved. For those of us who have walked with him, I think there’s a sense of awe and wonder. Because of that awe and wonder, we love him. We know he is awesome and big. We love him for that reason. My question to you is…Do you have a proper fear of God when you gather together to worship corporately or what you do alone in your house? Have a proper fear of him. You know, you’ve always heard it said, “It’s better to be feared than loved.” That’s a secular statement. I think Jesus wants both. I think he wants our reverence, he wants our fear, and he wants our love. It says the fear of God is the purpose behind the Commandments. Then he is going to pick one of the commandments up, and he is going to preach it. In particular, it’s the first commandment. Not only is the purpose of the commandment to fear God, but then it’s going to come along with a promise. That is if you fear God and you do what he commands, there’s a blessing that comes along with it. What’s that blessing? Well, it’s going to go well with them in the land to which they’re going over to possess. Verse 2: “…that you may fear the Lord your God, you and your son and your son’s son, by keeping all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, all the days of your life, and that your days may be long.” God is looking, and he is saying to them, “There is a blessing for keeping my Word.” When God’s Word prospers, they prosper. He says there’s going to be a blessing. What’s the blessing? Perseverance of identity. He is going to keep their identity amidst a wicked and evil generation. That’s the blessing. “I’m going to keep your identity.” How is he going to keep their identity? He is going to keep their identity through the family. God looks and sees the family as a means of a blessing for keeping the identity of his people. God sees the family as a blessing. We see the family as an inconvenience. God sees the family as a conduit by which our faith is passed on from one person to the next. That’s how we preserve ourselves. I mean, have you considered what is it we have to offer the world? Is it stuff? Is it money? Houses? All of those things will go away. What we have to offer the world is our worldview, our faith. The way we will preserve that is through the family. Our perspective on the family (I’ve heard it said) is, “One for me; one for you. Thank the Lord we’re through.” It’s true that Muslims understand this point. They understand it well. If you think about the classical sense of the way of the Muslim belief according to their own scriptures, they are planning to spread, and they’re planning to spread through proselytization, sharing their faith. According to their scriptures, they’re planning to spread also through force. Then finally they’re planning to spread… They get this right! They understand this. We don’t. They’re planning to spread their faith by means of children. They have big families, because they want to see their faith preserved. Christian, right now we’re not having enough children to see our faith sustained. But God sees the family as a means for preserving the faith. The conduits by which our faith is passed on is one father being faithful to sit down and to tell his sons about the goodness of God and how mighty God is to save. There’s a blessing that comes along with it. God’s Word prospers. We prosper. Then he is going to pick it up, and he is going to preach one of the commandments. “Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one.” I’m going to stop. This is the commandment. He is not talking in terms of being how God the Father relates to the Son and the Holy Spirit. Here he is talking about the exclusivity of God. There’s no other God like God. He is the only one. The way we teach this in Next Gen is to say, “God is best, he gives what is best, and he knows what is best.” That’s the way we teach it over there to the kids. Really what we’re getting after is the supremacy of God. There’s no one better than him! There’s no one who has the quality of character. There’s nothing else better that he could give us other than himself. There’s nobody like him. The supremacy of God. God is what is best, he knows what is best, and he gives what is best. That’s the first commandment. Now follow with me here, because what comes after that first commandment is the natural consequence. If he really is God of the universe and if he really is the only one, then what follows is a natural consequence of that reality. Verse 5: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.” This is natural. If he is who he says he is, this is what he would demand of us. Do you hear that, unbeliever? He is your Creator. Because of that, because there’s no other God like him, he demands this of us. What follows then in verse 7 is also a natural consequence, meaning the context for how we’re going to talk about family discipleship comes out of the first commandment. Because God is the Supreme Being above all things, because of that, because he is one and he is best, “You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.” Teaching our children about the supremacy of God is just a natural consequence from who he is. The tangible way we demonstrate God is solely Lord over our lives is by teaching our children. Let me say it in the negative way. If you don’t teach your children about the supremacy of God, it’s probably because you really don’t believe he is supreme over all things. If a single person were to come to me and say, “Hey, I want to know about how to have a good family,” perhaps I would start talking with them (and I would) about family discipleship. I’d start talking with them about prayer. I’d talk with them about time together as a family. But behind all of that is this press toward the Supreme Being. God is supreme over all things. Because of that, you should do these things. The driving force behind us doing all of this is the fact that we believe in the reality that God is best. It’s comprehensive. “You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.” It should be in everything you do! Parents, this is what we’re after. In everything we’re trying to demonstrate to our kids a theology of, “Son, God rules over me and all of my life. So you can see a theology of what I believe about God and how that controls how I handle money, what I believe about God and how that controls how I treat you.” All of that! We’re trying to demonstrate that comprehensively to them. We don’t want a secular/sacred split, meaning somehow what I do at church matters to God, but what I do in other areas of my life doesn’t matter to him. A good way to produce a kid who doesn’t love Jesus is to have that split in your heart, in your life. What we’re trying to do is show a comprehensive nature that God is supreme over all things. Because of that, he reigns over it all. One of the ways we want to talk about this with parents is we’ll say, “First be intentional with your time.” Make sure you’re spending time catechizing and talking with them and examining where they’re at in the faith. We do this in education. We look at a student who perhaps is in the twelfth grade and can only read on like a third-grade level. We look and say, “Something is wrong.” We take assessment. We do that in sports world. If you’re in high school playing basketball and you can’t dribble with just one hand, we say, “Look, you’re behind.” Parents, we should do this to our children as well. We should look into their lives and examine and try to figure out where they’re at and how we can take time and disciple them. Not only that, we want to think about moments. We want to be faithful with our children with just different moments that go on in their lives. As they fall down, it’s a good opportunity to talk to them about the goodness of the Lord even when things are going badly, right? In all moments of their life (and please hear me), if we’re not faithful with the day-to-day small moments, when the big purity talk comes up, don’t expect to be able to have the authority to shepherd then. We want to be faithful in all of life to sit down with them and point them toward the supremacy of God. Then not only that, we want to talk about the milestones in their life. We want to celebrate what God is doing and what he has done. We want to remember how God has brought us through difficulty. We want to have those moments in their life where you’re getting together with them and pointing to reasons to celebrate God and reasons to remember when he has brought us through difficulty. So time, moments, and milestones, but all of it comprehensively is us just continuing to point to God is best. Here’s a radical point that comes along with this. When a child looks and he obeys Mommy or Daddy, what’s going on there is that there should be a one-to-one. Mommy and Daddy are so obeying God that when a child obeys Mommy and Daddy, it should be the same as them obeying God. You say, “That’s radical.” I agree. Look with me at Ephesians, chapter 6. “Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. ’Honor your father and mother’ (this is the first commandment with a promise), ’that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land.’” Did you catch that? That’s exactly a similar phrase we find in Deuteronomy, chapter 6. Oftentimes you’ll hear something like this said from Dad. “You’d better obey me. You’d better listen to me. Do you want to live long? You’d better obey me. Something weird is going to happen. A plane is going to come out of the sky. It’s going to fall. It’s going to hit the ceiling, and that speaker is going to fall off and fall on your head. You’d better obey me. Do you want to live long? Obey me.” What’s going on here contextually is in Ephesians 5 (before chapter 6) the husband is living his life like Christ. He is living in a sacrificial way, so he is painting the gospel with his life. Then Mom is submitting in a certain way. She is submitting in the way the church is supposed to submit to her Savior. So she is painting the gospel. The assumption then once we get to chapter 6 is that when the child obeys Mom and Dad, Mom and Dad are so obeying the gospel that the child is obeying the gospel. When the gospel prospers, we prosper. What’s at stake in our family discipleship is the very keeping and upholding and perseverance of God’s people by means of the gospel. That’s what’s at stake. It’s something more than trying to make sure your daughter doesn’t get pregnant. It’s something more than trying to make sure they don’t end up bad people. What’s at stake is the preservation of God’s people through the gospel. That’s what is at stake here. It’s the preservation of the message of deliverance. If we were to flip back to Deuteronomy 6 again and we were to turn over then to verse 10, we’d find out this is what he wants them to remember. “And when the Lord your God brings you into the land that he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you—with great and good cities that you did not build, and houses full of all good things that you did not fill, and cisterns that you did not dig, and vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant—and when you eat and are full, then take care lest you forget the Lord, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. ” Don’t forget that God is mighty to save. He saves you in such a fashion that you didn’t even have to. That’s what he is saying to them. “You didn’t even have to build the city.” It was that good of a salvation. He purchased you, saved you, and he was mighty enough to do that where you didn’t even have to lift a hand. How does the family fit in that? Well, then verse 20. “When your son asks you in time to come…” It’s a good thing! The kid is looking, and he is seeing Daddy live out stuff. It’s making him ask questions. It’s a good thing! “’What is the meaning of the testimonies and the statutes and the rules that the Lord our God has commanded you?’ then you shall say to your son, ’We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt. And the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.’” God is mighty to save. That’s what’s being passed on to the son. God is mighty to save. As I’m concluding here, let me help you see this even more so. In the book of Genesis, Adam and Eve are created in perfect harmony with God. They mar that harmony by rebelling against God. This is where we think you’re at, unbeliever. You rebel against God. They sin against him, and so they’re put out, if you will. But right there in Genesis we get what is called the proto-euangelion (the first gospel, if you will) where God sees sin, and then he kills an animal. He kills. Blood is shed so he can cover his children. It’s a picture of what Christ will do on our behalf. We sin. He kills his Son so that he may cover us. Why does that happen? To show a picture: God is mighty to save. Cain then sins against his brother Abel. Then we see that sin is furthering. It’s increasing. It’s going on all the way to the point to once we get to the story of Noah, we know there’s evil and wickedness all over the earth, so much so that God fills the earth with water as judgment. His holiness is offended. He judges the earth. He pours water out. But then there’s a message in there. God is mighty to save. How? He takes Noah and his family, and he puts them in a small boat, and they are protected from his judgment. It’s a picture of the cross, us being in Christ. The waters subside. The land is still wet. The boat has finally hit the land. They get off the boat, and we see…what? Sin. But the good news is God is mighty to save. He gives us the story of Abraham, and he says to Abraham, “I’m going to make you a nation. I’m going to give from your descendants a huge nation. You’re going to have multiple sons and daughters.” Abraham figures, “Well, if you’re going to give me multiple sons, I at least have to have one.” So he tries to start getting one for himself. Through adultery and sinful circumstance, he tries to get a child for himself. Yet God demonstrates he is mighty to save. He gives him Isaac. Then he tells him, “Take Isaac out into the middle of the woods and kill him.” If you know redemptive history, if you know the Bible, you know at this point, if Isaac dies, it’s all over. But then God demonstrates, “I’m mighty to save.” What he is saying to them is, “If this child dies, it’s okay. I’m mighty to save. I’ll raise him from the dead just to keep my promise.” It’s a picture of the resurrection. Abraham has Isaac. Isaac has Jacob. Jacob has 12 sons. Those 12 sons are the first picture we get of a family. They are dysfunctional. Does that make you feel better about your family? It does for mine. They’re dysfunctional. They sell their brother off. Joseph gets sold off into slavery. He then goes, and he is in captivity. He is in slavery there in Egypt. But the good news is then there’s a famine that happens in the land, and his family is literally about to die. They get ready to go to Egypt, and they think this is their last hope. But what they meant for evil, God meant for God. God is mighty to save. Joseph is standing there, and through his forgiveness, the people persevere. His people persevere. Then they go into Egypt, this small, ragtag family. They come out in the millions. As they’re coming out, they’re no longer just in spiritual captivity. They’re now in physical captivity, physical enslavement to Pharaoh. God delivers them through miraculous wonder and deed, and he says to them, “I am mighty to save.” That’s what’s going on here up until this moment. He wants them to make sure they continue to pass that story along. Dads, you can do this. You can do this even if you’ve blown it. You can demonstrate by going to your kids and repenting of your sin and saying to them, “I’ve done all these things wrong, but God is mighty to save. Look at what he has done in my life now.” You can do this, single person. You can go, and you can tell the message of deliverance by spreading the gospel. If we were to jump from here over into the New Testament, Ephesians, chapter 2, we see the bad news. We were dead in our trespasses and sins, but God is mighty to save. In Christ Jesus, he has made us alive together with Christ Jesus. This is what is at stake. This is the message we hold onto and we proclaim to one another. May we be diligent to pass that along to our children. Let’s now bow to the Lord in prayer. Lord, we thank you for your goodness. Lord, we thank you for your Word. Lord, we thank you for saving us, purchasing us. Lord, may we never move beyond that message. May the centrality of what you have done to save us and purchase us be always the thing that fuels our right living, our family discipleship, our love for one another, our gatherings together. May it all be centered around what you have done to save us. Jesus, we love you, and we thank you for your salvation. In Jesus’ name we pray, amen."
10,a gospel tuning,1,"It’s a joy to be able to stand here today and open the Word of God with you. We launched our campus on September 7. We’re now in the eleventh week. This is the first time we’ve had live preaching here at the Plano Campus. So it’s exciting to be able to stand here and open God’s Word and proclaim the excellencies of Christ with you in person. I love our church, our structure. I love Matt and how we pipe him in live every week, but there’s just something unique about being together as family to think about the family, to think about the gospel. That’s where we’re going to be today. If you have your Bibles, go ahead and turn to Colossians, chapter 3. When I started thinking about what this weekend needed to look like, I knew that first and foremost we wanted to preach the gospel. We don’t want to come here and preach morality. We don’t want to come here and preach a “You can do it” sermon. We want to preach the gospel. We have been a people, the church, set apart by God for God’s eternal purposes. Secondly, we wanted to look at what the implications are of the gospel in our home life, with our families, with our spouses, with our kids, with our roommates, if we’re single in here. We can’t just think about living the gospel out when we find ourselves in a chair on a weekend service here. We can’t only think about singing songs about who God is when we come into this room. The hope would be that in our homes on Tuesday nights when we find ourselves on our couches or on Wednesday nights when we’re sitting around the dinner table with family and friends, that we’re living, thinking about, talking about the gospel. It’s all of life. It’s all of our home life. It’s all of our church life, believing in, trusting in, the power that Jesus Christ came to save sinners. That’s the hope. That’s the point of this thing called life, that we would live and breathe the gospel. Parents, when your children disobey, that you would correct and discipline from a posture of the gospel. Husbands, wives, when you’re in little tiffs, that you would sort through and work through those things with gospel implications, being motivated by Christ’s forgiveness in your own life as you forgive your spouse. Singles who have roommates, that you would out-show one another in honor, that you would cultivate a culture of repentance in your own home, that you would model the supremacy of Christ in the context of your home life. All of our home must be filtered through and motivated by the reality that Jesus Christ came to this world to save sinners, and through his death and resurrection we now have the ability to live holy, set-apart, vibrant lives. What I want us to see today is the way we approach discipleship, specifically in our homes, must be evaluated and measured by our understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We’ve just been asking and praying that the Lord would allow us to hear some things today and leave this place with the renewed understanding of the implications and power of the gospel and how it should affect your home life. You’re in Colossians, chapter 3. I’m just going to read the entire chapter. It’s not that long. Then I’ll pray and we’ll get going. “If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. On account of these the wrath of God is coming. In these you too once walked, when you were living in them. But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator. Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all. Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them. Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged. Bondservants, obey in everything those who are your earthly masters, not by way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord. Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ. For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.” Let’s pray. Father, I ask that you would move in this service, that you would take these words, that you would stir within the hearts of men and women in here. No matter where we find ourselves today, I pray that we would leave here loving you more, knowing you more. Father, I fully confess and trust that it is only by the power of your Spirit that hearts would be changed. I put no stock in my rhetoric, in my sermon, in my speech, in my thoughts. I put everything in your hands, God. Help us. Enable us by the power of your Spirit to believe these truths today. We love you and we thank you. In Jesus’ name, amen. I grew up here in Plano. I went to Plano Senior High School right down the road. (Go Wildcats.) I graduated and was set to go to Arkansas to college when some friends of mine called and said, “Hey, what if instead of going to school next year you came on the road and joined our band?” I was like, “Yeah, let’s live that dream. That’s awesome.” It took me literally three seconds to go, “I’m in.” Then I had the thought, “This is a pretty life-changing decision, so I should probably ask my parents.” So I asked them, and they were gracious. They said, “Yes.” In fact, their exact words were, “You can go. We don’t care how long it takes you to finish school or where you go to finish school, but we want you to go to college.” I took that as, “I’m going on the road.” So I jumped in a van with these guys. We hit the road. We traveled all over the US and saw some incredible things. I grew personally and spiritually during that season of my life. There was one memory that sticks out above all other memories. We were playing a show in Lubbock, Texas, and there were about 500 people at this event. It was a great night. It was a fun evening. The way we started our worship set off was with the song, “We Are Hungry.” Does anyone know that song? The chorus goes, “We are hungry, we are hungry, we are hungry for more of you.” If you grew up in the late 90s, early 2000s, in church culture, you sang that song 3,800 times. It was the hit. It was the go-to song. We started that song off, and the way we started it off was just by me on the bass playing the notes. So I started us off. I was feeling it. I was kind of in the groove. I was looking out, seeing if everyone was feeling it the same way I was. The singer then started with, “Lord, I want more of you, living water rain.” Hands started to go up, and the mood was set. I was going, “Man, this is feeling right.” We’re in the zone. The way we did that song was I played the whole first verse by myself on the bass with the singer, and then the chorus was the big crescendo. That’s where everyone came in. The drums came in. The other guitars came in. So we get to the chorus, and everyone comes in confidently. As soon as everyone comes in, it sounds like a cat is being strangled. It sounds atrocious. I mean it’s not a little bit off. Like, we can’t just push through this song anymore. It’s bad. Hands are starting to come down. Someone is completely off key. I’m looking around, looking at my bass, making sure I’m playing the right notes. I’m looking at the band. I was like, “What in the world is going on?” Everyone is kind of gazing at each other. The singer doesn’t just slow it down and take a step back. Into the microphone, he just goes, “Okay, stop, stop. Everyone stop.” It’s just dead silence. He goes, “Hey, Hunter, I think you’re out of tune, man.” Every eye went to me. My eyes got big, and I just hung my head in shame, like “This is so awkward.” I slowly kind of tapped my tuner, and sure enough, I was really out of tune. I was in tune with myself, but I was basically in a different key than the rest of the band. I tuned up, and we started the song off again from the beginning. We played it, and it was awesome, but it was really awkward in the moment. As awkward as that was for me, I think there’s a healthy takeaway from that story that we need to consider today. I don’t claim that this thought is groundbreaking. I don’t think anyone is going to leave here and go, “I never thought about that before,” but I do think it’s important. Here’s the takeaway: being in tune matters. It certainly matters in music, but that’s not what I’m talking about. Being in tune matters. Have you ever thought about that, that internal, intentional heart examination to make sure your life is in tune, specifically with the gospel, how it shapes us, how it motivates our decisions? Being in tune matters. We must be a people who are constantly making sure we’re in tune with the gospel, that our gaze and focus is fixed on things that are above, not things on this earth. What happens is when we are tuned into things of this earth, we are going to fall into an exhausting cycle of thinking we’re our own problems’ solution, of thinking we have the ability to fix our marriages, to fix our kids’ lives, to fix our job circumstances. Then we’re going to try harder and we’re going to fail all the more. All the while, we’re neglecting the fact that Jesus has already taken care of this for us in the cross. That’s what Paul says in verse 3, as he’s reminding the Colossians to live a holy life, to think and dwell on things that are of God, things that are above. He reminds them and says, “Your life is hidden with Christ. It has already been taken care of.” Paul reminds the Colossians, and I think it’s a good word for us today, to stop and consider if we’re in tune or not. In verses 5-9, he gives 11 indications that show us we may be out of tune, 11 sins that show us we’re not walking with our minds set on heaven, that we’re walking with our gaze fixed on the earth, on the temporal. Those 11 are immorality, impurity, passion or an overmastering lust, evil desire, covetousness (which is idolatry), anger, wrath, malice, slander, obscene talk, and lies. That’s a nasty list. No believer in here would say, “Yeah, I want to be known by those things.” That’s not holy living. That’s not what we’re called to in Christ Jesus. These things are the old self. These things are not what mark us as believers in Christ. Here are a couple of quick points about these verses. If you’re in here today and you read this list and you think and consider where you are in here and you think these things define you, let me just say this as best I can: welcome to humanity. We all have these wrestles. We all have these struggles. We all have seasons where we struggle with anger or malice or slander or obscene talk or lies. That’s just part of this tension and struggle we live in in this world. We have been redeemed and set free by Christ, yet we still live in the flesh and operate in a fallen Genesis 3 world. There’s that struggle. There’s that tension. So don’t let guilt creep in today if that’s what you feel. Confess those things to the Lord. Confess those things to a friend or a spouse. That’s not who you are anymore. Secondly, Paul doesn’t hold up a mirror and list these things out to show us how wicked we are. No, Paul confidently says, as he’s written, “Stop acting that way. Stop living that way. Put those things to death. Take off. Put away.” That’s pretty strong language to the believers, that he would say, “No longer do you have to wear those nasty hand-me-downs of pride and anger and malice and obscenity.” He says, “Take those things off.” Why can he say that? Because he knows, himself included, that it has already been taken care of in the cross. We don’t have to live that way. We don’t have to find ourselves in that exhausting cycle anymore. It has been taken care of. If you’ve been crucified with Christ, those things have also been crucified with you. Christ took those things to the cross, and he has given you a new identity. He has given you a brand new wardrobe through his blood. Paul is not telling the believers in Colossae to muscle through their issues, not in their own strength. That’s not what he’s doing. He can confidently say that they, that we, that he… No longer are we held captive by these sins. We have a way out. I think, for many of us, we do find ourselves wrestling with these things, and if not this specific list, things like this list. We find ourselves always being lured back by the enticements of these sins. I think the reason we do that so often is we have an identity problem. I think we have an identity problem, because to know who you are informs your behavior. If you know you’re a husband, you know you’re not going to spend your days eating ramen and showering every three weeks. That’s what single guys do. That’s not what husbands do. You know you’re a husband. You behave like a husband. You act and live like a husband. You’re not going to want to go back to that stale ramen day. To know who you are informs your behavior. If we forget who we are in Christ, then we’ll easily slip out of tune. Again, the solution is not to try harder to be good. The solution is to constantly be reminded of and sit beneath the reality of what it means that Jesus Christ came into this world to save sinners, to save you, to save me. So who are we, then? If we aren’t marked by idolatry and hate and pride, what are we marked by in Christ? Paul affirms our new identity in Christ by reminding us of three things. These three things, if I’m just being honest with you, are easy for us to forget and hard for us to believe. These three things are in verse 12. Believer, you’re chosen, you’re holy, and you’re loved. You’re chosen. I don’t know if you maybe didn’t get picked in kickball growing up. They didn’t choose you to be on the team. Maybe that was just me. I don’t know. But that’s not what it is with the Lord. He chose you. He sought you out. He looked down and said, “I want that man, I want that woman on my team.” Before the foundation of the world was ever created, he took initiative in setting up a redemption plan for you through his Son Jesus Christ. He was determined to have you as his own. We forget that so often. We think we bring things to the table, that we save ourselves, that we chose to be on God’s team. That’s not right. That’s not biblical. That’s not accurate, according to what the Word of God says. The Word of God says you are chosen. That’s one of the truths, one of the marks of your identity in Christ. The Creator of the universe, who spoke it into existence, chose you, son, daughter. Not only did he choose you, he calls you holy. This may be more difficult for you to understand. You may think, “No way. God, how in the world can you use the word holy to define me, to describe me?” You think about all of the struggles in your life. You think about the many times a day you slap the Lord in his face with your rebellion and sin. There’s no way God calls you holy. But hear me. I think that’s the point of the cross. That’s why God sent his only begotten Son to die the death that was reserved for us. We can’t fix ourselves. We aren’t holy. We are messed up. We are jacked up, and we can’t fix ourselves. We can’t put away that old self. We should have been the ones on the cross, not Christ. We’re the idolizers, not the Son of God. We’re the criminals. We’re the villains. We’re the lawbreakers. We’re the thieves, not the perfect Son of the living God. That cross had my name on it, but Jesus was the one who was nailed to it. All of my sin was put on Christ and was washed away by his blood, and he took my rags of death and in its place gave me his robe of righteousness. Because of that, I am now positionally seen clean before a holy God. He now looks on me, looks on us, as righteous, and he sets us apart for his eternal purposes. Oh, that we would marvel at that truth today, church, that in Christ, we are chosen and holy. Thirdly, we’re loved. God didn’t just choose us, set us apart, and then abandon us. He loves us. He continues to pursue us with his affections. He’s crazy about us. I wasn’t just talking to the kids earlier when I said that God loves them. He loves all of us. There’s nowhere we can run. There’s no sin we could commit that would ever make him stop loving us. Paul in Romans, chapter 8, says that God loves you and there is nothing you can do about it. There’s nothing you or anyone else can do to make God stop loving you. He loves you, and his love is real. As real as Mount Everest is, God’s love is more real and grander. As real as the Indian Ocean is, God’s love is deeper and vastly more real. His love for you is real. Believer, you’re chosen, you’re holy, you are loved. These are the realities of our identity in Christ, and I think if we keep these three things before us each and every day, they’ll keep us in tune with the gospel and how we live our lives and how we interact with others. To bring this back to my initial hope for our home life, discipleship in the context of the home is too important for us to approach being out of tune. Discipleship is too important for us to approach if we’re out of tune. We have to make sure we’re in tune. We have to make sure we’re believing these truths every single day, because when we do that and we think about God’s love for us, then and only then can we truly love our spouses, love our kids, love our roommates. When we understand how kind God is to us to choose us, to redeem us, to forgive us, we can then be kind to others and extend forgiveness to others. When we trust and believe that the fullness of joy is found in the right hand of God, then and only then can we have joyful marriages. When we believe and trust in his provision for us, trust in his goodness, then and only then can we trust others. See, it’s all connected. It’s all woven together in our identity with Christ Jesus. We understand love because we’re loved. We understand compassion because he was compassionate. We understand kindness because he was kind to us. We understand forgiveness because he forgave us. Do you see how it plays out? If we’re out of tune, we’re going to miss all of those things. We’re going to think he’s an angry, bitter God who’s not near, who doesn’t care for us, who has left us alone by ourselves. We’re chosen. We’re holy. We’re loved. If we forget our identity in Christ, if we’re out of tune, if we don’t have Jesus at the center, then, wives, you won’t submit to your husbands as it’s fitting to the Lord. You’ll become bitter and frustrated and view yourself as a slave in your home. Husbands, you won’t know what it looks like to truly love your wife and to lay your life down. Your motivation to love her will be for your own selfish gain, what you get in return from her. Parents, when you discipline your children, you’ll do it to protect yourself from embarrassment when they act up in public rather than understanding your child’s disobedience is ultimately against the Lord. Singles, you’ll be so consumed with finding a spouse you’ll forget what a gift you have to be in a place where you can wholeheartedly serve the Lord. Do you see what I mean, how it’s all connected? We cannot forget who we are in Christ. We have to make sure we’re in tune. As I mentioned earlier, our home life, our life outside the walls of this church and inside the walls, must be evaluated and measured by the gospel of Jesus Christ. Here’s how I want to close our time out today. I want us to do some evaluation. I want us to take a few moments and just ask the Lord. Here’s what I’m going to ask. Just go ahead and close your eyes right where you are. I just want to ask you a list of questions, as you evaluate honestly where you are today in this place. If you took a self-examination, would you be able to say that you’re in tune with the gospel today? Are you living your life confident of your security in the Lord? Do you believe you’re holy in God’s sight? Do you know you’re loved? If you say, “Hunter, no, I’m having a tough time believing those things,” then go ahead and confess that to the Lord. Lay those things down. Ask him to remind you that you’re chosen, that you’re holy, that you’re loved. Husbands, are you loving your wife from an understanding of how loved you are in Christ? Wives, are you submitting to your husband as unto the Lord, or are you submitting just so he’ll stay off your back? Parents, are you knowingly or unknowingly discouraging your kids by placing your expectations on their lives instead of the Lord’s? Singles, how are you doing serving and encouraging your friends and roommates? Kids, are you obeying your parents today just so you won’t get in trouble, or are you obeying because it pleases the Lord? I think it’s important that we really search our hearts and slow down and, if we need to tune up, that we tune up this morning, because we’re about to step into a season where our culture is going to scream at us to set your mind and affections and your wallets and paychecks toward things of this earth. It’s about to get chaotic here in America. The slogan is about to be it’s all about you and your happiness and your joy, that you’re satisfying your own desires, when the gospel’s call is that they’ve been satisfied in Christ, because Christ has satisfied the wrath that was due toward you through his cross. So maybe today we would leave here and have some honest conversations with our families and friends on our way home. Heavenly Father, I ask that you would move in this time, that you would continue to remind us of your great love for us, being chosen by you, being set apart by you for your eternal purposes. We love you. In Jesus’ name, amen."
11,faith-works,0,"If you have your Bibles, go ahead and grab them. James 2 is where we’re going to be. The alarm went off this morning, and as I get older it takes longer to recover from this kind of time switch we’ve done. I have read there are some states that just said, “We’re not doing it.” If any state should do that, it should be Texas. So if one of you wants to get to work on that I’ll be with you and encouraging that. But anyway, the alarm went off this morning, and groggy-eyed I began to ask the Lord to do what I ask him to do every week when we gather. Really to frame that for you, I think the fight we’re in together, the fight I’m in with you is really for your and for my delight. As we talk about strategy and structure at The Village Church, what I’m fighting and what I’m thinking about is really your delight because I can believe that where your delight is is really where the rest of your world is going to follow. So I’m asking the Lord on your behalf, on my behalf that he might do a profound work in us that enables us to feel and to intellectually know God in a way that leads to a delight that drives our lives. I asked him this morning, and my hope coming in to preaching the Word of God to you today is that we might see and savor Jesus and rest and know the delight and peace that comes from knowing we are fully forgiven, that we are deeply loved, and we are affectionately liked by faith alone. That’s my hope, that you would understand that delight, the delight that comes in knowing that, that all of our sin, past, present, and future, has been paid for on the cross of Christ. I say that all the time, and yet I find myself constantly in conversations where we just don’t believe that to be true, that you are fully forgiven because of what Christ has done for you on the cross. Regardless of how you dragged yourself in here today, that would be true for those of us who are sons and daughters of God in Christ. I want you to know the peace and delight that comes in knowing he loves you, that your Creator God who knows everything about you hasn’t just forgiven you, but that he loves you, and on top of that, not only has he forgiven you and not only does he love you, but that with deep affection he likes you, and not some future version of you, but the messy, goofy, ignorant version of you right now. (No offense.) If you get that and you know that, there’s a delight, there’s a sense of peace, there’s a rest in the soul that begins to make its way through your heart and life. It melts away the cold places. It softens the hard places. It establishes righteousness deep in our soul, a righteousness that is not of ours by works but rather a gift of righteousness from God made possible in Jesus Christ. I desperately want you anchored in that hope, assured in that hope, unmoved from that hope, that as you live out the days of your life, as your week progresses and you have the peaks and valleys of your week that what would be constant is the delight in knowing your Creator knows you, has forgiven you, loves you, and (I’ll say it again) affectionately likes you (and, look at me) not because you did anything but rather because he did everything. Are you tracking with me? So you would rest in all of that being true not because you used to and now you don’t, but all of that simply being true because of Christ and his life, death, resurrection, and ascension, and that your anchor would be that alone, that by faith alone you have been adopted as a son or daughter of God. I want you to know it. It’s the way I pray for you. It’s what I think we’re talking about when we start talking strategies and structures at The Village Church, we start talking programs, we start talking sermon series. Where my heart is is, “How can I increase their delight in you, Lord? How can I help them see and savor and be deeply moved by these realities that are true for them? How can we communicate in such a way that they’re freed up from the near-constant enslavement to works-based righteousness and set them free to just know they’re loved in you? How do we do this?” That’s how I woke up praying this morning, wanting you earnestly to delight in the Lord, wanting you to leave this place today really unburdened by the weight of feeling like you must perform for the Lord but rather that you might be able to simply rest in the fact that the performance has already happened in the life, death, and resurrection of Christ, and now you get the benefits of that performance. His perfect obedience imputed to you, his perfect righteousness imputed to you so that when God looks upon you in Christ he sees the righteousness and perfection of Christ and calls you his beloved. I desperately want to get you towards that delight, and so I think to get there I’m going to let the Word of God lean on us. I will just, right out of the gate, tell you this. The passage we’re in this morning is one of the more difficult passages in the Bible, and it’s one of the more argued-about passages in the Bible. With that said, let’s dive into it. I’ll give you, even before we read it, James’ point. James is going to say that while faith alone saves us, it’s a faith of a certain kind. So that’s what James’ argument is going to be. Here’s what he’s going to say. It is a faith which produces works which saves us. The works do not save us, but a faith that does not produce works (and we’ll define that term works here in a minute) is a faith that will only deceive and cannot lead us into the fullness of life or into eternal life with our Father. So here’s the outline of the text. I’ll just give it to you. Faith without works is useless, faith without works cannot save, faith without works is ineffective, and faith without works is dead. It’s no faith at all. So that’s the outline of the text itself. You should be able to pick up on that as we read, and so let’s dive in, starting in verse 14 of James 2. “What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, ’Go in peace, be warmed and filled,’ without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. But someone will say, ’You have faith and I have works.’ Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that God is one; you do well.” That’s a compliment there. “Even the demons believe—and shudder! Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, ’Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness’—and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith [that is] alone.” That’s a better translation there. “And in the same way was not also Rahab…” I love, love, love that Rahab is in this text. “…the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.” Now you can feel your internal legalist starting to activate, can you not? Can you not immediately just reading this text start to feel like, “Okay, give me the list. Do I have to learn how to play the acoustic guitar? Do I have to get up at 5:00 a.m.? What is it? Go ahead and give me the list. I feel it. Faith without works is dead. I don’t want to be dead. Give me the list of works I have to do”? We can feel it in this text, but let me tell you what James is not saying. James is not, cannot be arguing that works must be added to faith. He cannot argue that way. If he argues that way, the cross of Christ means nothing. Do you hear me? If James’ argument is now that we have our faith we must add works to that faith, that is the opposite of everything I have ever preached to you in the last 12 years when I have said on repeat that the gospel of Jesus Christ is not a door we step through only to forget and get to work cleaning ourselves up, but rather the gospel saves us, sanctifies us, and holds us firm to the end. So James is not arguing that now that we have faith let’s get to work on our works. He cannot be arguing that way. To argue that way would belittle the cross of Christ and mean we are fools and there is nothing for us in the sacrifice of Christ, that we are still enslaved to the law we’ve never been able to accomplish, right? You know that, right? Do we need to do the Ten Commandments thing again? Do we not? We don’t. Okay, so you fail all 10 of them. If you’re a guest, you go through all 10 and you fail. Zero. You don’t get to make up. God is not interested in self-esteem. He’s not going to go, “Oh, you made a zero. Try it again.” You’re always going to make a zero on that. We cannot, weak as we are in the flesh, fulfill the law. One of the reasons the law was given is show you you can’t, that you do need a righteousness that’s greater than your own, namely the righteousness of Christ. So James is not arguing that works must be added to faith, but rather his argument here is that genuine biblical faith will inevitably be characterized by works. Now before we get going and you start getting out your notepad and getting ready to list out the works you have to add to your faith, let me define two terms. Here’s the first. I want to talk about what faith is. All right, here’s faith. Faith trusts God and faith obeys God. We’ll talk more about why it has to be defined by that as we make our way through this text, but faith trusts God and it obeys God. If it doesn’t trust God and if it doesn’t seek to obey him even imperfectly, it’s not there. But that’s James’ argument in about three points, that it’s dead. Then I want to define works. Is James talking about the Torah? Is he talking about the Law? Is he talking about the Ten Commandments? Well, earlier in chapter 1, you saw James talk about the royal law of love, and so he’s going to argue really from Christ’s perspective. So here’s how we’ll define works. Works is a life of loving God and loving others. There is your works. Now as I’ve said from week one to now, this week right here, what God is looking for is progress not perfection. No one in this room is going to perfectly love God and perfectly love others. Did anybody fail at that this week? Let’s go ahead and do it. All right, so if you don’t have your hands up, you now can check off that “I’m a liar” thing on the Ten Commandments and prove my point. So everyone in this room we’re saying that faith without works is dead. It’s ineffective, it cannot save, and that ultimately it is useless, and yet right here in this room we just all of us, 100 percent, confessed, “I have not loved God and loved people like I ought this week.” So hear me. My argument will not be, cannot be, must never be that you must add works to your faith to validate your faith, but rather legitimate faith leads to an ongoing love of God and an ongoing love of others as imperfectly executed as it might be, and where those two things do not exist I would not enter into rest that is not yours to enter in. But with that said, let’s walk into this. Faith without works is useless, it cannot save, it is ineffective, and it is dead. Let’s start with the first. It is useless. Faith without works is useless. So if you say you have faith, if you say you trust God and you say you’re going to obey God and your life is marked by loving God and loving others and there’s no movement in that, it’s useless. Look at the illustration starting in verse 15. “If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food…” Now let me just talk to you for a second. When it says “poorly clothed and lacking in daily food,” he’s not saying he’s wearing a Knights of the Round Table polo instead of a Polo polo. Right? It’s not poorly clothed as in “Got that at Wal-Mart.” That’s not what he’s saying here. He’s not saying a brother is not fashionable; he’s saying this person who’s a part of the covenant community has fallen on the type of times in their life where they’re not able to survive from day to day. They are naked and cannot eat. They are completely and utterly in trouble. What good is it if “…a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, ’Go in peace, be warmed and filled,’ without giving them the things needed for the body…” Here’s his question. “…what good is that?” What good is that? See, where there is perceived faith with no works, it’s useless and God does not minister through both the one in abundance and the one in need. So when we say that faith without works is useless, in James’ illustration that cuts two ways. Here are the two ways it cuts. For the poor man, he receives blessings from the Lord. For the destitute man who is unable to eat and unable to clothe himself and his family, he is ministered to, encouraged, loved on by God via the wealth of the saints, and the wealthy man is used by God in profound ways to minister to those who are hurting among them. See, I think that where faith isn’t active things start to really break down in a hurry. Here’s what I mean by that. If you have been given by God, you have not been given by God so you might constantly be increasing the size of your house and car and barn and 401(k). I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with any of that as much as I’m saying that’s not the primary purpose by which you have been blessed by God. You have been blessed by God to live an open-handed life that shows you are not enslaved to those blessings but rather are grateful for them. See, what happens when faith is static, it’s not moving, is that we have a tendency to become spiritually constipated. Are you tracking with me? Don’t make me draw that out anymore than I did. Just those two words are all I’m going to give you. You have been blessed by God, and are now to be a conduit through which the blessings of God flow. You rob yourself when you’re uppermost in your own affections while disguising it in religious language, because that’s certainly what this person just did. He just said, “Hey, God bless you, brother in your nakedness. You’re not going to survive the day. Children starving to death. Be warmed. Hey, do you know what you should do? You should eat dinner. That’s what I would do. If I were you, I’d put some drawers on and I’d eat some dinner. God bless you.” What good is that to the one in trouble and what good is that to the one who has been blessed by God to help his brother in the day of trouble? Faith without works is useless. In fact, we see here (and Beau pointed this out several weeks ago), James tends to mirror the teaching of Christ in some places identically. I think this section in particular mirrors Matthew 25:40-43. If you know this text, Jesus is telling the parable about separating out the sheep and the goats and saying to the sheep, “Hey, you fed me. You cared for me. You visited me in prison. You came.” Then to the goats, he says, “You never did that.” I’ll read the text to you. Matthew 25:40-43. “And the King will answer them, ’Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’ Then he will say to those on his left, ’Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’” So Jesus’ point and now James’ point is that as we experience the grace and mercy of God, as we rest in that saving faith alone, our heart begins to be transformed and changed so that our love for God starts to translate into a love for people. That our love for God translates into a love for people. It’s not a love for people that makes us love God but rather a love for God that translates into a love for people…look right at me…an imperfectly executed love for people. People are hard, huh? There are some people I don’t like. Anybody? You just leave me up here hanging with my hand up? There are people I don’t like. Do you have anybody in your life you avoid if you see them? Go ahead unless you’re sitting next to them. So look at this. This is hard, and if you did, you failed this morning in your trying to maneuver. Here we are. We’re being honest about the difficulty of this. The answer to the difficulty of people is not to just try to make it work, but rather to fall more deeply in love with Christ. How’s that possible? But for faith. Faith without works is useless. Here’s the scary one and the one in which we’ll spend the most amount of time. Faith without works cannot save us. It’s mentioned in a couple of places, but the argument is in 17-25, so let’s read this. “So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. But someone will say, ’You have faith and I have works.’” Okay, so here’s what he has done. James has just interjected an antagonist into the letter. I don’t know him personally, but if James is passive-aggressive, this brother is actually in the church that this letter will be written to. All right? He’s like, “Let’s just say hypothetically speaking there was a guy who would say that faith and works are two separate things and shouldn’t be tied together in any way.” So that’s what he has just done. It’s a form of argument where he would say, “Someone would say. I don’t know, maybe Bill. Somebody here would say…” So it’s a form of argument. But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Here’s James’ dissecting of this trying to parse apart faith and works. “Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder! Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, ’Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness’—and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith [that is] alone. And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?” So this antagonist James has introduced into the argument is saying, “Now faith and works are separate. They’re just two different things. If you get those things too close together, it’s dangerous. So you have works, James, but I just have faith that the Lord will save me.” That’s the argument. So here’s James’ argument against such an idea. The first one is this. “Okay, you have faith. That’s great. Show me. Show me.” If I could make it simple… You’re sitting in a chair. There’s an aspect of faith for you sitting down, correct? My wife collects antiques. That collects probably is overstated. She buys old chairs and decorates the house with them. I don’t know if your spouse does something like that. So there are chairs in my house I have no faith in. Maybe that’s a good way to say that. There are chairs… She’s like, “Just sit there.” I’m not sitting there. I know how that ends. That ends with me visiting the chiropractor. I’m not sitting in that chair. Then these chairs. I have no problem sitting in these chairs. They’re made of steel. Right? So here’s James’ argument. James is saying, “Hey, you’re saying you believe that the chair will hold you. Well then, have a seat. I’ll show you I believe the chair will hold me by having a seat. Mr. Antagonist, have a seat. Do you believe the chair will hold you?” “I absolutely believe the chair will hold me.” “Well, have a seat.” “Well, you know, I’m not sure.” “You’re not sure of what?” “I’m not sure I want to sit down.” “But you’re sure the chair will hold you.” “Absolutely confident that that chair will hold me.” “Well, have a seat, brother.” “Can we just stand and talk though? I’ve had some stuff back early in my life where I’ve had some issues with chairs. Do you think maybe we could just stand and talk for a bit?” “I mean, we can, but surely you’re eventually going to get tired. When you get tired, would you like to have a seat?” “Yeah, I don’t know, man.” “Well, do you not believe the chair will hold you?” “Well, I mean, I do. What’s it made out of?” “Steel, brother. You’re 130 pounds. This is steel. You should be fine. Have a seat.” “I’m just not sure.” Right? So James’ argument is, “Have a seat. I’ll show you I trust the chair. I’ll sit down.” Then he moves from this idea of “Show me faith without works.” How does that even look? What is that? So here’s what a clever man will do. A clever man will say, “Well, I intellectually, mentally believe what is doctrinally true about the person and work of Christ.” Now, you’re not going to slip something past the Bible and the arguments in the Bible for the good of your soul and the glory of God. So James immediately goes to where we want to go. “Well, I intellectually believe what’s true about Christ. I believe the physics of the chair being able to hold me. I can see this is steel. I know steel is strong. I can see the structure of the chair is sound. So I don’t need to sit down because I can see the chair will clearly hold me.” Well, James immediately dives into that argument. “You believe God is one? You do well, but even the demons believe that’s a chair and they shudder.” Intellectual assent to correct doctrine is not salvation. Look right at me. Intellectual assent to correct doctrine is not salvation.   See, this is where you come across the brother who knows a lot of doctrine, but his heart is all dry and crusty and crispy, and he uses doctrine as a club to whip people and beat them into submission, and his pride is built, his rootedness is found in his knowing the Bible better than you. No real love for God. No real love for people. He’s just smart. That smartness at times might betray him. Because James knows the argument. If you say you trust the chair, have a seat. It’s to argue about the structure of the chair and how the chair actually works, and if I only trusted more in the structure of the chair then I wouldn’t even need to sit down. I could just, like him, say, “Well, the chair will hold me.” But see, I’m a weak man because I have to actually sit to find out. Right? That’s the argumentation. James is going, “You believe God is one. Congrats. But even the demons believe that, and they’re not children of God. The demons believe that.” The demons have better theology than most pastors…this one included. They know more than I do, I can promise you. They know the Bible better than I do, I can promise you. Yet I have awaiting for me by faith alone what they can’t fathom, an eternity of reigning and ruling alongside the Creator of the universe. So they have correct doctrine, but it’s not saving doctrine. Then finally, the third response for this idea of faith and works being these separate things, they have no business being anywhere near one another as James is going, “Okay, show me your faith then,” and then secondly, “Don’t just go intellectually. You have to sit in the chair. If you’re going to say you believe the chair will hold you, you have to sit in the chair,” and then finally he finds biblical support showing that the unity of the Bible is that faith alone saves you, but not faith that is alone. He uses two illustrations. One shouldn’t surprise us at all, right? The first is Father Abraham, right? He had many sons. Many sons had Father Abraham. I am one of them and so are you, so let’s just praise the Lord. Do you remember that? If you didn’t grow up in church, you’re so lost right now, but if you did, you know exactly what I’m talking about. So Father Abraham showing up in this text as a defense for James’ argument being written primarily to Jews should not surprise us, but Rahab the prostitute? There are no songs about Rahab. Anybody remember the Rahab the prostitute song? You don’t! There’s not one, and yet how important and beautiful is this woman in the lineage of our salvation! I love that Rahab stands here. What you have is the argument that Abraham revealed he trusted God by sitting down in the chair. So Abraham had faith. “God has given me an heir. Through that heir the nations, the world is going to be blessed.” God says, “Let’s sacrifice that promise on the altar,” and Abraham by faith put his son on the donkey and headed up the hill even as Isaac said, “Dad, where’s the ram?” “The Lord will provide.” With trepidation, trust, and hope, he headed up the mountain, and the Bible tells us he bound his son. Can you imagine? Don’t dehumanize these people. He bound his son and was prepared to sacrifice when the Lord stepped in and said, “Don’t.” See, Abraham trusted God. How do we know? Because he took the promise up on the hill. Abraham had faith that the Word of God would come into its fullness. How do we know? Because he took Isaac up on the hill, because he bound him, and he was ready to be fully obedient to God, trusting that God is able. Then really, after that moment, we don’t see any more of the kind of foolish wickedness Abraham was marked by in his early life when he lied and said, “Hey, that’s not my wife. That’s my sister. Abimelech, you can have her. Just don’t kill me.” I just have to believe that that came up for the rest of their marriage. I mean, you don’t whore your wife out to save your own skin and not hear about that in arguments in the future, right? So Abraham. It’s not a surprise he’s here. After this moment, his faith in the Lord is robust. We don’t have any of that silliness his early life was marked by. Then we have Rahab. Now here’s what I need to do. I’ll set my Bible over here. I’m going to walk over here for a second. Rahab, one of my favorite biblical characters, is a prostitute in Jericho. No little girl dreams of being a prostitute when they grow up. You become a prostitute because very wicked, evil, demonic, deplorable things happen to you. You are used and abused, treated like a commodity, treated like a soulless recreational vehicle. Rahab in Jericho, used and abused. Women were already treated as not even second-class citizens. What would a prostitute be if just women in the court were treated as second-hand citizens? Can you imagine the type of abuse she had to endure? The longings of her heart. Here are the spies being sent by Joshua to scout out Jericho. “We’re going to conquer this massive fortified city.” Rahab, having caught wind that the people of God, that salvation was coming, began to help the spies. Then when she found out that word had gotten out the spies were there, she hid them and then redirected them and put her faith, her small faith that this God would usher in what is new, that this God would usher in a new beginning for her. I love that Rahab is here because what I feel is probably happening right now. It’s your waiting for me to get to that list of things you must do. How simple was Rahab’s step? Hide them. “Well, God, what if they come in here and use me? What if they show up and take advantage of me? What if they treat me like a cow or like some commodity?” “Trust me, Rahab.” “Okay, hide over here. Remember me when your God gives you this city.” Rahab finds herself in the lineage of our Savior, and therefore is our family. It was just a step. Faith without works cannot save you. What do I mean by works? You saying, “I’m a Christian,” with no love for God that leads to love for others as imperfectly as that is executed means you should stop calling yourself a Christian. I love you. You’re not one. See, I’ve said this a lot. I think the most miraculous baptism testimonies we do start like this, “I grew up in a Christian home.” Like, are you serious, Chandler? I’m totally serious. Not the witch? No, the witch knows she’s a mess. Not the drug addict or the promiscuous. Of course, I know where that leads. It leads to heartbreak, so it makes sense for somebody to go, “I’ve been addicted to heroin for 10 years. It destroyed my life, and Christ saved me.” We should applaud and rejoice of the saving work of Christ. But the kid who grew up in church picks up Christian jargon. He picks up Christian language. He knows, she knows what to say, when to say it, knows the behavioral expectations of the community, and it’s easy to play the part and not have a heart that loves Jesus. It’s easy for a bulk of your life to have your parents’ faith. Now folks, just a side note real quick. I’m not encouraging you to not pour into your children and read the Word of God over them and help them with language and structures and understanding. I’m also telling you don’t freak out when they fail because one of the things I love seeing in my children’s wickedness is, hey, that can be regenerated. That can be regenerated. That type of sickness, that type of sin, that type of foolishness, that exposes their need for Christ. Then from there, it can’t be lost what he just argued, so I’m going to just spell it out for you. James is saying, the Word of God is saying, that there are those who claim faith, they claim to be Christians. They are connected to the community of faith. They’re active in their church. They confess an orthodox faith. They’re even supporters of the faith, and they do not love God, and it has not led to loving others, and therefore they are not saved. Are you ready? I’ll do it again. I know some of you are like, “Hey, bro, you started this thing with delight, man. It feels like a bit of a bait-and-switch here.” We’ll get there. There are those who claim faith who are connected to a community of faith. James is writing to people in the church who confess an orthodox faith, who are supporters of the faith. If you went to their Facebook page, they would have all sorts of little links to cool YouTube religious clips. They’d have a favorite preacher, a favorite author. They’re in, but they don’t love God and that loving of God has not led to a loving of others, and James’ argument is, therefore, they are not Christians. They are not Christians. So faith without works is useless. Faith without works cannot save. Then faith without works is ineffective. One of the things I’ve tried to lay before you again as often as I possibly can work it in is that all of the commands of God found in Scripture, every “Thou shalt not” and every “Thou shalt” is about God inviting you into the deepest life possible. Every week of this James series I have said what God is doing in James is inviting you into the richest, most full life imaginable. He’s not trying to steal from you anything. He’s inviting you into all there is to have. In every family with a child you go through this season where you’re trying to convince the child that the pool is awesome, right? So the kid stands on the side of the pool, and what you do as a dad, as a mom, is you get real close. You’ll be like, “Come here. Jump to me. Jump to me.” They can clearly see (I’m 6’5“) that the water is up to my thighs. ”Jump to me.“ ”I don’t know. Scoot closer.“ I’m like, ”My thighs are also touching the side. There is no closer.“ Then you can pick them up and get in the water, and they grip on, and they’re like, ”Ah!“ You’re trying to convince, ”Hey, this is awesome! You’re going to love this. There’s going to be a day I’m not going to be able to get you out of here without threat. Trust me. Jump into me.“ There’s fear and there’s nervousness. If you’re like me, you’re trying to reason. It’s like, ”Have I ever tried to drown you in the bathtub? Do you think I’m going to do it now publically in front of all these people? Jump to me. Look, if Dad wanted to kill you, he’d have done it already, all right? Now come on. Come to me.“ I’m just kidding. This is what is happening here. When God says, ”Don’t,“ when God says, ”Do,“ when God says, ”Pursue me,“ the invitation is, ”All you want is found in this direction. Jump in. All you desire, all you hope for is this way.“ So we’re nervous like the kid standing on the side of the pool, and until you jump in, you’ll never really understand the delight of what it looks like to swim. So faith without works is ineffective. If faith is meant to lead you into trusting God and obeying God and loving God in such a way that it flows out into love of others, the invitation isn’t a bunch of, ”Quit doing this and start doing this,“ but it’s, ”See me, love me, pursue me, chase me.“ This is why if you wonder why I’m constantly going, ”Look up. Quit looking at you. Of course you’re a failure at this,“ it’s because of this right here. Then lastly, faith without works is dead. This is a strong statement. He uses it twice in this passage. What he’s arguing is that faith without works is not merely outwardly inoperative but rather inwardly dead. He’s saying faith without works isn’t faith. I’ll let Charles Spurgeon give us a good illustration here. Spurgeon was the pastor of Metropolitan Tabernacle in London, a massive church in its day. Upwards to 10,000 with no amplification. Just a total beast. Here’s what he said about this passage. ”A tree has been planted out into the ground. Now the source of life to that tree is at the root, whether it hath apples on it or not; the apples would not give it life, but the whole of the life of the tree will come from its root. But if that tree stands in the orchard, and when the springtime comes there is no bud, and when the summer comes there is no leafing, and no fruit-bearing, but the next year, and the next, it stands there without bud or blossom, or leaf or fruit, you would say it is dead, and you are correct; it is dead. It is not that the leaves could have made it live, but that the absence of the leaves is a proof that it is dead. So, too, is it with the professor.“ Those who say they have faith but have not works. ”If he hath life, that life must give fruits; if not fruits, works; if his faith has a root, but if there be no works, then depend upon it the inference that he is spiritually dead is certainly a correct one.“ Do you hear Spurgeon’s argument? It’s not the leaf and apple that make the tree alive; it’s that the tree is alive that produces leaves and apples. So there is no list. Maybe this illustration in closing might serve us. After my conversion, a man who was discipling me gave me this sentence. Discipline not desire determines destiny. I love that sentence. I think if that sentence is applied into certain areas of life it’s effective and helpful and good. A disciplined life is a good life. It’s a terrible sentence to put on your relationship with Christ. No, no, it’s desire that leads to discipline that determines destiny. I love my wife. I love her. Her name is Lauren. We’ve been married quite some time now. I love her, and that love drives in my life discipline. I’m disciplined about date nights. I am disciplined about doing certain things around the house because I know she likes them. I’m not doing those things in order to make me love her. Are you tracking? It’s not like I get up in the morning going, ”Man, I’m really not feeling Lauren right now. I mean, I wish I could get out of this marriage. I have no feelings for her anymore except contempt. I know! I’ll clean the kitchen, and if I clean the kitchen then I’ll love Lauren and Lauren will love me back.“ That sounds idiotic, doesn’t it? Does everybody agree that sounds idiotic? Like, ”I just have nothing but contempt for my wife. I know! I’ll take her out on a date. I’ll spend time with her in my contempt for her.“ I mean, that’s just going to do nothing but exacerbate contempt. Right? No, no, no. It’s my delight in her that drives the discipline; not the discipline that drives the delight. So what are the works of the saint? To know the Lord and to love the Lord. So how do we do that? When Peter preaches in Acts 2, at the end of his sermon, the crowd just cries out, ”Just tell us what to do!“ Then he says, ”Repent and be baptized.“ What would I tell you to do? What I’ve tried to tell you to do for 12 years. Position yourself under the waterfall of God’s grace. The importance of the gathering, the importance of Christian community, the importance of the Word of God, the importance of prayer is not that those things save you or that those things in and of themselves are a type of fruit that verifies you’re a Christian, because we’ve already covered you can be doctrinally astute and not a believer. No, no, no. These things fuel an understanding of the Lord and love for the Lord. See, one of the things that happens as I spend time with my wife is I get to know her more deeply. Here’s what’s interesting about Lauren. Lauren just keeps changing. She keeps growing. She keeps progressing in life, and so there’s always something new to learn about her and to appreciate in her and to marvel at God’s work in her. In the same way as God is an inexhaustible well, there’s always something else to marvel at, always something else we’re just now starting to understand. Now how many of you have followed the Lord 12 years or longer now? Yeah, now put your hands down. Now how many of you even now are coming across things in the Word of God, coming across things in your prayer life, coming across things in your relationship with the Lord that are like wowing you because you didn’t see it that way, you didn’t get it? So go ahead and raise your hand on that one. So here we are. There’s always something new. So we do these things not in order to love him but rather they fuel our love, inform our love for him. The works faith creates is a love for God that leads to a love for others, imperfectly executed but present. So I can with full confidence tell you this. If there’s no inkling mustard seed of love for him, if other people for you are a means to an end, they exist for you and there’s no real love for them, stop calling yourself a Christian. You’re not one. I don’t care if you got baptized when you were 6 years old because your dad told you about hell. I don’t care if you walked down an aisle and prayed a prayer with a pastor. If there’s not even a mustard seed of love for the Lord, you’re not a Christian. You haven’t been given a new heart. Now on that delight piece, here’s where I’m fighting for your delight. Because if you came in here all banged up and beat up, trying to serve the Lord, feeling like there’s no fuel for that, no real love for the Lord, this could be a simple season of desert weariness, or it could be you’ve never confessed and repented and asked the Lord to reign and rule in your life. So the delight that’s offered to you today is that door to walk through. See, I’m not a fool. Our first chairman of the elders was saved when he was the deacon at another church. Deacons getting saved? How does that work? Well again, we already read what James argues. The reason a sermon like this that just basically goes, ”Hey, question your assurance,“ really is the opportunity to delight in the saving work of Christ, because if you just got exposed you got exposed by the sovereign King of glory as a type of invitation into assurance. One of the things I want to do today, the reason I’ve pared back this message because it could’ve been much longer, is I want to give you some time to consider before we dive into the elements. So I’m going to pray, and as I pray, men and women are going to begin to hand out the elements around Communion. We’re not done, so don’t jet out. This is an extremely important Sunday to not bail. When I say amen, they’re going to begin to hand out the elements, and then I’m going to give you about five minutes to just consider the things that have been said. Give you about five minutes to just consider and weigh your heart to do the hard work of diving in and going, ”Is there a mustard seed of love for the Lord? Is there a mustard seed of affection being given towards others, compassion towards others? Or is none of that present?“ If not, I want to give you just the opportunity to cry out to the Lord for salvation. The same truth you celebrated can be yours not intellectually, but yours spiritually. That should be the desire of our hearts. Not intellectual assent; internal transformation. One little step at a time. Let’s pray. Father, for the weak and weary, will you encourage their hearts? Those whose faith feels so weak, I pray you remind them that according to Jesus a mustard seed of faith will eventually become a tree so large that birds of prey perch in it, and mustard seed faith can move mountains. So I pray they not feel condemned or weighted down by their tiny speck of faith, but rather that that tiny speck of faith might lead to a deep assurance and delight in you. But I do pray for those who have learned Christian language, they have learned Christian behavior, they have learned Christian posture, but they do not know you. I pray you would not let them escape today, that you would lovingly expose and that you would lovingly reveal their need for you, their need for repentance, their need for salvation. Help us. It’s for your beautiful name, I pray, amen. A couple of things on Communion as they begin to pass those out. We practice open Communion here. What we mean by that is if you are a believer in Christ in good standing with the church you’re visiting us from, please celebrate the Table with us. We are heirs of God together in Christ, and so it’d be foolish not to celebrate what Jesus has done for us. But I would like to ask this. If you’re not a Christian, and I don’t mean you’re wrestling with what has been said this morning. I mean, you know that even as I talked, ”Whatever. Hurry up. Got lunch. Not interested.“ If that’s you, will you just abstain? This will not make you lucky, and this will not forgive any of your sins. It’s grape juice and a cracker, but to those of us who have been bought by the blood of Christ, it is a sacred and profound moment of remembering all God has done for us in Christ via faith alone. So as they pass out the elements, here’s what I want to give. I want to give you just four or five minutes here to consider, to think, to mull over what the Word of God has said so we might partake together as a family with all the more boldness and confidence in his saving work by faith alone. If it has been revealed in the last 35-40 minutes that we are not Christians, then might we cry out for salvation and find the Lord to be near and at the ready. Just want to lead us in a couple of prayers here. Would you just keep your head bowed and eyes closed? I want to give us the opportunity. If there is persistent and willful neglect to put sin to death in our lives, let’s spend a moment or two confessing that. Where there is secret sin, where we do not take sin seriously in our lives, we play with it, try to train it, justify it, deny it, let’s spend just a moment or two here confessing before the Lord. Where there is willful and consistent neglect to pursue a love relationship with the Lord, let’s spend some time confessing that, asking the Lord to fan into flame the hope he has put into us. Let’s ask the Lord to increase our confidence in his saving work, to give us eyes to see whether that mustard seed of faith is there. Not intellectual assent, not church attendance, not right doctrine. Whether that mustard seed of love for him and others is present. Give us clarity, Father, and it’s for your beautiful name I pray, amen. The Bible says that on the night Jesus was arrested, he took the bread and he broke it, and he said, ”This is my body broken for you, paying for all of your sins. Do this in remembrance of me.“ In that same night after dinner, he took the cup, and he blessed it. One of the things about the Table of the Lord is it’s one of the things that actually should fuel our delight in the Lord. It should fuel our faith to love and trust him because it’s a reminder that he is for us and not against us. It’s a reminder that he is better. It’s a reminder that he has covered our sins. The reason this moment in our service is so important is because what are doing here except remembering there’s no sin with more power than the cross. He took the cup and he blessed it. He said, ”This is the blood of the new covenant, my spilled blood shed for you. Don’t forget it.“ Father, we confess just in closing today that you are better. Jesus, you are better. You’re better than any treasure, any pursuit, any other desire of our heart. So even as we begin to sing, Jesus, that you are better, would you take that truth just out of our minds alone and will you drop it down into our gut so we would feel and understand and be transformed by the reality you are better. There is no pursuit, no treasure worth more than knowing you and loving you. Help us. It’s for your beautiful name, amen. Love you guys."
12,hearer-doer,0,"Hello, friends. Good to see you. Those of you in Plano and Dallas and Fort Worth, as always, it’s good to be seen by you. I know you’re there. For those of you who I have not had the privilege of meeting, my name is Beau Hughes. I’m one of the pastors and elders here on staff. I have the privilege of serving at our Denton Campus. As always, I just want to bring greetings from our brothers and sisters up north. I’m just so thankful for the way continually… I know I’ve gotten to say this a few different times now, but just how you have just labored with us, cared for us, been mindful, and even remembered us in your prayers often as we’re in these days as a campus of transitioning to a new local church up in Denton (The Village Church – Denton). I’m just grateful to be able to be here and even convey that on behalf of our congregation, how deeply grateful we are, how much we love you and thank God for you. It’s crazy days up there. You know, Matt has three sermons left with the Denton Campus, so we are right at the heart and really at the tail end of this transition preaching-wise. There’s so much going on, but I’m always delighted to be here with you. If you have a Bible, why don’t you turn to James, chapter 1? We will be where the text you just saw on the screen had us. We’ll get there here momentarily, but what I’d like to do is start in a bit of a different place with you this day. You know, one of my favorite seminary professors in seminary was Dr. Jonathan Pennington. He was one of my New Testament professors. One of the most impactful things he had us as students do was he actually had us first of all read the New Testament in his New Testament class and not just different books about the New Testament. That was deeply impactful. Then every week, he actually assigned us portions of the New Testament to read, and he had us as we were reading them and re-reading them do an assignment for each of those portions of Scripture where we would be looking for particular things he was asking us to look for. We would look for things such as just various cross-references other Scriptures from the Old Testament or the New Testament that came to mind as we were reading through that passage, even just the author’s big idea. We would take these chunks of Scripture and say, “Okay, zoom out. What’s the big idea? Don’t get lost in the weeds, but kind of zoom out. See what the big idea is.” Then probably the most impactful thing for me that he had us do with every assignment of the Scriptures we were reading in the New Testament was he would have us listen for and look for echoes of the teaching of Jesus in the text, especially in the texts that didn’t talk about Jesus. We weren’t looking for the name Jesus in Colossians. We were actually reading Colossians, and even where it didn’t say anything about Jesus explicitly, we were listening for echoes of Jesus’ teaching from the tradition of the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John). For every passage, he had us do this again and again and again. This is something that really stayed with me. I had never thought about this before. You know, Pennington’s thesis was the fountainhead of all of Scripture is Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John (the Gospel tradition about Jesus…his life, his teaching, his death, his resurrection). This is the fountainhead of Scripture. The Old Testament leads there. The New Testament comes out of there. We need to be listening for how that fountainhead shapes (especially in the New Testament) what is written. What’s being taught? What’s being said? What’s being admonished? What’s being exhorted by the writers of the New Testament? This is something that really as a pastor I have a burden. As we study books of the Bible (especially again in the New Testament), we get to continue to grow in as a church. Even tonight as we’re reading from the book of James, we would be listening for the echoes of Jesus, because James actually is an ideal place to start for something like this. Even in your personal Bible study, this series of the book of James could be a great place to start and read the Scripture with a greater ear toward perhaps the Lord Jesus Christ and his teachings and what he lived and modeled and said while he was among us. Because James, even though it only mentions Jesus twice… I don’t know if you knew that. It mentioned him the very first sermon we did. You know, verses 1 and 2 mention Jesus, and it mentions him again at the front of chapter 2. Those are the only times you find Jesus as a name explicitly in the book of James. If you’re not careful, because of that, what you’ll begin to do is read the letter of James or any other letter in the New Testament in this sort of moralistic or therapeutic way without even knowing it. It becomes wisdom but wisdom that’s actually detached from the person and the work and the voice and the teaching of Jesus. What’s amazing about the letter of James is, even though it only mentions Jesus twice explicitly, the whole letter is actually like a little commentary on Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount. If you remember Matthew 5 through 7 and if you read the letter of James with that in your mind and really with that echoing in your ears and in your heart, you will begin to see and to hear the teaching and the imprints of the Lord Jesus Christ’s ministry all over the book of James. The book of James really is this long application letter of the Sermon on the Mount that, of course, James (the brother of Jesus and, more importantly, the servant of the Lord Jesus who became not just his brother obviously but his Lord and Savior) is reflecting on what the Lord taught, and he is applying that into the churches of his day. I’m really excited, because even the sermon tonight, even the text we’re going to be studying tonight from the end of chapter 1 of James, really does come forth out of the summary Jesus gave in his teaching on the Sermon on the Mount. If you’re in James 1, we’ll get there in a moment, but I just want to read this from Matthew 7. This is how Jesus concludes his sermon in Matthew 5 through 7. He says this. After he said everything he said, he says… “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.” You know, Matt mentioned a couple of weeks ago that the overarching concern pastorally of James as he was writing these letters to the churches is that they would walk in the way of wisdom. I would agree with that wholeheartedly but in the way of wisdom Jesus outlines and defines here. What James is wanting is the churches to build their life together, to build their community together amidst persecution, amidst temptation, amidst all the behaviors they’re still struggling with because they’re not fully sanctified yet. They would build their life together on the rock. Yet there were temptations. There were circumstances. There was oppression even persecution and suffering that was coming upon them that was actually threatening them from not doing this, from not hearing the word of the Lord Jesus and doing it but actually just sort of doing things their own way. On top of that, even just the circumstances we talked about last week, the trials that came their way from the outside. There were also worldly desires from the inside of the church, from in their hearts, that were swaying them and pulling them off the road of wisdom as Jesus defines it here. There’s anger and ungodly speech that are running rampant in the church. There’s partiality and covetousness laced all throughout the community. James is deeply concerned about this. This isn’t a letter he is writing from an ivory tower. He is in the trenches, in the weeds, hearing the stories, knowing the lives of the people in these churches. He is concerned that what the church’s circumstances and what their worldliness is revealing is their faith may not actually be genuine. He is really concerned that they may actually be deceived about their relationship with God, that these churches James is writing to, just like these crowds Jesus was speaking to… James is concerned they may think they’re building their life on the rock, but all the while, they’re really building their life on the sand. That’s James’ concern throughout the whole letter. As we move into really the heart of the letter today and where we’ll be actually the next number of weeks, the next three and a half chapters really, we get a front row seat at the end of chapter 1 here to how the Holy Spirit inspired and led James to address these problems and these concerns about the churches of his day. Echoing his Lord and his Savior and his Brother’s teaching in the Sermon on the Mount, what James is going to do is he is going to take the particular behavioral struggles, the particular circumstantial realities in these churches, and he is going to blow right past them, and he is going to make a pathway straight to the heart of the problem. The heart of the problem is whether or not these churches, whether or not the people who are gathering in these church gatherings, actually have faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ or not. Let me pray, and then we’ll look at what he wrote as he was carried along by the Spirit of God. Father, we thank you that your Son has come, and he has lived, and he has died, and he has rose, and he is one day returning again and going to make all things new. We thank you that he has left us the Spirit who even now as we gather will lead us into truth, will give us ears to hear, eyes to see, faith to believe, hope to enjoy. Spirit of God, we ask now as we read these words you inspired so very long ago, you would make them come upon us in ways that transform us from the inside out, that leave us changed. We love you, Lord. We thank you. We draw comfort even now that you’re with us. We don’t read this letter together tonight in isolation. We read it together, and we read it most of all led by your Spirit. We pray these things in Christ’s name, amen. If you’re with me, let’s look in James, chapter 1. Matt covered through verse 18, but we’re going to start in verse 16 and go through verse 27. We’re going to start in verse 16 because I really think verses 16 to 18 are actually sort of a hinge for this first part of the letter here. Let’s look at verse 16. This is what James wrote. He said, “Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers [and sisters].” Again, if you remember last week, deceived about…what? Well, they’re in the midst of their trials. They’re in the midst of their temptations. They’re in the midst of wrestling and really grappling with sinful, selfish desires. He is saying, “I don’t want you to be deceived. God is not the one who is tempting you to sin. That’s not what’s happening here.” He said, “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.” I just love verse 17 because James says, “Listen, God is not tempting you to sin. We have a good Father in heaven who never changes. He is a good Father, and that means he only does what’s good. He only does good things to us who are his children, and we experience everything good and everything perfect because it comes from his very kind hand.” If you’re tempted to believe God is the reason you’re tempted to sin or you’re bailing on your faith, let me just speak to that and say that’s not true. The opposite is actually true that we have a good God, a good Father who gives us everything we experience that is good in this life. He said most of all verse 18 is an example of how good God is. “Of his own will [thisgood God and Father] brought us [who are Christians] forth by the word of truth [the gospel]…” Circle that “Word of Truth.” That word word is going to come up again and again here as we go through today. “…he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we [as the people of God] should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.” This is a majestic statement that our God, our Father for those of us who love and trust Jesus Christ, not out of compulsion but of his own goodness, of his own love, of his own grace, brought us forth. He caused us to be born again. We were dead. All of us were bad seed, and yet he brought us up as the firstfruits of his harvest of salvation. That’s an amazing, majestic statement. I know most of us in our Home Group this week weren’t talking and really exclaiming about the fact that we’re firstfruits. “We’re the firstfruits.” Does anybody talk like that in your relationship? Is that something…? You know, maybe we’re saints. We’re sons and daughters. What he is saying here is, “No, no, no. Your identity as a church is you’re firstfruit of God’s creatures.” What does that mean, and why would he say it? What it means is God has decided to redeem and reconcile all things to himself. That’s the story of the world. That’s the drama we’re caught up in, whether we know it or not. God is moving things toward salvation, and salvation is that day when God is fully going to make all things new. His will is going to be done on earth as it is in heaven. Even as is exclaimed in other passages of Scripture, through the death and the resurrection of his Son, he is reconciling all things to himself…things in heaven, things on earth, making peace by the blood of his Son. That’s what God is doing. That’s where the world is headed…toward everything that’s sad becoming untrue. What James is saying here is we as the church God has chosen for his own good pleasure, for his own good wisdom, for the church to be the firstfruit of that. The church, as dim as it may be, is meant to be a snapshot of where God is taking the rest of the world. That’s our identity. As one theologian said, the church is the model home of the community that will one day be in heaven. We’re the model home of what the neighborhood of heaven is going to look like. This is what God is doing. We’re the down payment. This is beautiful news, because this is our identity. In his own wisdom, he has started his work of salvation by sending his Son and reconciling a people. One day it will be a people of every tribe and tongue and nation, but right now what James is focusing this church on is, “Listen. You’re a firstfruit.” Here’s why he wants them to know that. Here’s why this is so important. He wants their vision of their identity and their destiny to transform their character in their present circumstances. He is pointing them to their identity, and he is saying, “This is who you are. You’re a firstfruit.” He is saying, “This is your identity. This is your destiny.” A firstfruit of what? Salvation. All things being made new. He is pointing them to this identity and this destiny, because what James knows is that in order for people’s character to be truly changed and transformed (especially in the midst of temptation, especially in the midst of trial, especially in the midst of us grappling with our indwelling sin), what we need is a vision, a picture, a narrative of where our life is headed. If we don’t have a picture, if we don’t have a vision, if we don’t have a narrative of who we are and where God is taking us, then we will struggle. We will fall. We will drift. We will not finish the race. What James knows is what changes and motivates people, what actually transforms character, is beauty. You don’t start with rules. You don’t start with details. You start with beauty, and you start with an attractive vision or a narrative of what is to be. I mean, you even think like this outside of the spiritual realm. You know, if you want to really give a child a vision of playing the violin well, do you start with the rules of violin, or do you go and take her to a concert and let her watch a master violinist and get a vision for what playing the violin is? Or do you start and say, “Well, this is what the rules are. Let’s just walk through this. Let me just tell you all the details about it”? It’s not either/or. You have to eventually get to that, but if you really want something that’s going to compel that little girl when her hands get tired and her fingers are done with plucking that violin and playing that violin when they’re sore, what’s she going to need? She is going to need more than a rulebook. She is going to need a vision, a beautiful, compelling vision, that in the midst of that trial, in the midst of that weariness, in the midst of that discouragement, in the midst of that failure, is going to compel her to persevere because she has a vision of what could be. It’s the same way for us in Christ. Only beauty transforms. Rules don’t transform. You know this, which is why some of us for years just came to church services. We tried to do the rules. We came week after week, year after year, and we just didn’t see very much transformation in our life. We were trying. Maybe some of you are still here. You’re trying to follow the rules of faith, but your heart was never stunned or transformed by the beauty of God and your identity, our corporate identity, as the firstfruit of God’s salvation. When your heart gets stunned by that, it changes. It transforms! It doesn’t mean everything gets better. It doesn’t mean everything gets easy, but it does change us. Moral instruction without a captivating vision of beauty will only produce whitewashed tombs and rebels. Beauty transforms. James right here at the beginning of this letter, right here as he is introducing what he is going to introduce, sets down this beautiful vision in verse 18 of their identity as the firstfruits of God’s salvation harvest. Then he spends the rest of the letter, in light of this beauty, admonishing them how they’re to live like that. But you have to get this. This is who you are! This is who we are (those of us who are Christians). What that means is if we’re the firstfruits, then there’s a certain way God has ordained not only for them to be brought about (which is by his own grace and mercy, not because of our works), but there’s a certain way also that now that we’ve been brought about, he expects our faith to work itself out in our day-to-day living. He gets into it here in verse 19 in the specifics that are going on, but he does it again in light of this vision of their identity and their destiny. He says (verse 19), “Know this [be aware of these things], my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger.” These are behaviors if you’re going to stick around for the whole series (which I hope you will) James is actually going to address in this letter again and again and again. One of the more pronounced and really concerning ways the community was not living in light of their identity and their destiny as the firstfruits of God’s salvation was they were struggling with speaking and listening and anger. James wants them to know this anger (especially here as we’ll come back to it) that’s working itself out in their mouths is not pleasing to God. He says that very plainly in verse 20. He says, “For the anger of man does not produce the righteousness [or the justice] of God.” James’ point here is really simple. “The behavior going on in your life together is not something God approves of. This anger, this way of speaking…” You know, Jesus again from the Sermon on the Mount puts it even just more straightforwardly. “This is not good fruit. This being quick to speak, slow to hear, quick to anger is not good fruit.” That’s essentially what James is saying here, and he is afraid this is actually spoiling their health and their witness as the firstfruits community they’re supposed to be. Friends, when James (just like Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount) is talking about anger here, he is not only talking about the external outbursts and fits that happen in our lives that may have happened in your life today or yesterday or this week. He is talking about that for sure. Let’s not pretend as if our preschoolers are the only ones who have fits of anger or jealousy or whatever. He is also talking about the deeply settled anger underneath the behavior as well. He is talking about the deep-seated lusts and fears and entitlements and pride of our heart that creates the outbursts, that energizes the outbursts. It’s where the outbursts come from. That’s what Jesus said, right? Oh, you say, “Don’t murder anybody,” but you hate in your heart. James is saying the same thing. They are actually saying these things with their mouths, and he is saying, “Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe you’re not murdering,” even though it seems like maybe they were if you look at chapter 4. But he is saying for sure this behavior is not okay. He is actually getting deeper than that as well. Don’t miss that. Listen, friends. As one who has battled with anger his entire life, I feel like I can in humility (and maybe even humiliation) just say to many of you in this room tonight that there are so many, I believe, here who you are more angry than you’ve ever dared admitted. You’re enslaved to it. You are an angry person, and you’ve been denying it. You’ve been justifying it. But you’re enslaved. You’re enslaved to the lusts of your heart and the lusts of your flesh. You’re terrified. You’re entitled, and it comes out. In some of you, it comes out really violently. Others of you, it comes out really passively, a violent passivity even. You’re angry. I think part of the invitation tonight (just so you know) is that if that’s you, as we talked about, God loves you. He has brought you here even tonight to invite you to be… Just like he is saving me, he wants to save you from that. He wants to heal you from that. He wants to transform you from that. I know that because he says it in verse 21. That’s where the Holy Spirit goes. He says, “Therefore…” Because these things don’t please God and because they enslave you, “Therefore, put away [or take off] all filthiness and rampant wickedness…” That word there to take off all filthiness is this image of these just filthy clothes that he is saying, “Take off. This behavior, this filthiness, this wickedness in your heart that’s coming out in your life that you’re walking in, take that off.” This is an invitation and an exhortation and admonishment, a command. Take it off. You know, it reminded me of these days they have mudrooms in houses. I don’t know if some of you are homebuilders or whatever. It’s like they’re actually putting mudrooms in houses. Back in the day, though, you just had to strip on the front porch. It was just, “Hey, you’re dirty.” You go out. You’ve been playing. You get muddy. It’s, “Hey, take off those clothes before you get into this house,” because Mama said that, and we’re going to do what Mama said to do. If that means I’m going to streak a little bit on the front porch before I get in and keep a clean house, that’s fine. The reality, though, is if we’re this worried even about our own homes, how much more the household of God? “Are you saying you just think you’re going to run about and you’re going to smear this stuff all over my household? Take those clothes off.” “…[put on or] receive [pick up and embrace] with meekness the implanted word [the gospel], which is able to save your souls.” This is the whole point of this passage we’re reading tonight. This is the exhortation. If you’re taking anything away, this is what he is saying. Take off all manner of filthiness and wickedness, and receive (put on, welcome, absorb, submit yourself to). Meekly humble yourself, and receive the Word of God. Believe the gospel. Submit your life and your heart to it. Don’t miss what James just did. Listen. He just took the concerning behavior (the angry hearts and the angry words), and he took it straight to the heart of the problem. He went straight to their submission of the gospel. He didn’t stay talking about their anger and, “Let me give you some techniques for how to sort of cool down in that moment.” Those things aren’t necessarily bad, but he didn’t do that. He said, “You’re angry. You’re speaking in a way that’s ungodly, that’s not producing the righteousness that pleases God. So you need to receive the gospel afresh. You need to submit yourself to the Word of God, which is able to save you. It’s able to save you from these behaviors. It’s able to save you from your sin that’s indwelling, and it’s keeping you from pleasing God.” He is saying, “Listen. Humble faith in the gospel is what pleases God.” This is the type of righteousness that goes deeper than that of the scribes and Pharisees. It’s submitting yourself, believing and receiving the gospel of grace. This is what saves us. It’s what contains all the power God would give us that we need to live and persevere in this life of wisdom and hearing and doing what we’ve been told to do. This is how, friends, we build our lives on the rock. We put aside, we take off, these clothes, and we put on or we embrace and receive the gospel…the truth of God’s grace he has given us. Turn away from your sin. Put on these. Embrace Christ, and obey him. Listen. Some of you here have never done that. You wouldn’t even profess to be a Christian, and I’m so thankful you’re here. If you’re going to take anything away, this is the message of Christianity that, left to ourselves, we can’t and don’t please God. But God has made a way for us to bring him pleasure and to be accepted by God. That’s through what Jesus Christ has done, what he is talking about here, the gospel. Jesus has come, and he has lived. He has died, and he has made a way through his wrath-absorbing death for you to be set free and for you to know God and for you to actually be able to please God as a firstfruit of his salvation. If you’re not a Christian tonight, that’s the message I would just admonish you to think about and to believe and to embrace just like he is saying here. What’s interesting, friends, is this letter is not written to those who aren’t professing to be Christians. He is not talking to those who are saying, “I’m not a Christian.” He is talking to those who think they’re Christians. Why does James do this? Why does he go right here right at the beginning of his letter? Why is he concerned about this? Why does he go here so quickly and then stay here for three and a half chapters? Because he is just going to beat this drum again and again and again. He is going to take different behaviors, but he is going to do the same thing again and again and again. I think what we’re left to ask is, “Why?” I’m grateful because he tells us why. He doesn’t leave us wondering. In verse 22 he says, “Do this. Receive this word.” “But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.” Ah! So there’s his burden that the people in these churches (professing Christians) are deceived about whether or not they have genuine faith. This is why he gets here really quickly. There are men and women in the church who think they’re pleasing to God. They think they’re in right standing with God, but they’re not. They think they’re right with God because they apparently (verse 22) are hearers of the Word. That means they receive it. They profess to agree with what they hear preached. They come to the church’s gatherings. They hear the elders teach. Even though they’re nodding to the creeds and singing the songs, their lives are filled with bad fruit. Their lives are void of obedience and meekness to what they’re hearing and nodding and singing about. Their hearts are filled instead with anger and jealousy that’s spilling out into their words in all manner of filthiness and wickedness. By definition, these professing Christians are blind to their self-deception. They are unaware that they are building their life on sand. They are convinced they’re building their life on the rock, and they continue to chug along, falsely believing they’re building their life on the rock. This is why James goes here, because James understands that what he said in verse 21… Meekly receiving the Word of Truth means more than just hearing it and nodding to it. It means to embrace it and to actually, in faith, act upon it. What he is saying is the one who merely hears the Word and has a lifestyle that is characteristically against doing what he hears, that person has not truly received the gospel. As James looks out upon the congregations in his mind’s eye that he is writing to, he sees places in the church that what they’re doing is characteristically (that’s an important word…characteristically) not aligned with what they’ve heard. As one preacher once said, they’re satisfied in the church with the buds of hearing without the fruits of obedience. This is why he goes here. This is why he stays here. This is what the Holy Spirit intends for us to pause and really think about together I think tonight as a church. I’m grateful 2,000 years or so later, church services and college ministries and youth groups are no longer filled with people who are deceived like this, especially in the Bible Belt. I’m thankful. There’s no longer any sort of deception like this that goes on, not even in this room. We’re not deceived, but let’s just do a little group exercise for fun. Let’s just imagine for a moment what it would be like if church services were still filled with people who were deceived in this way. Even better yet, let’s imagine for a moment what it would be like if you and I were deceived. You personally. Just imagine. What would it be like if you were deceived like this? What might some of the indicators be in your life? Your life. How would you know whether you really were building your life on the rock or sand? How would you know you’ve not only heard the Word of Truth (the gospel of our Lord), you’ve not only agreed with it in sort of mental assent, but that you’ve actually submitted your life to it? How can you tell? For the rest of this letter, what James is going to do is he is going to help us think through and answer these questions. The Spirit of God invites us to pull up a seat and say, “Hey, let’s just look in the mirror.” That’s actually the example he goes to in verse 23. He gives this illustration. He says, “For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.” That’s a pretty good illustration, Spirit of God. Thank you. What’s amazing is unlike today, mirrors in the time James is writing were not everyday objects in the first century. Let this blow your mind. People were generally unfamiliar with what they looked like. I thought about this. I was like, “That is crazy!” You know, I read some stat that people as high as eight times a day (sort of the average)… One of the studies said this is how often we’re looking in the mirror. These people who James is writing to didn’t look at the mirror. They didn’t have a little compact. When their babies were born, they weren’t looking up at themselves from day one just sort of fumbling about. They did not have a mirror. Even the mirrors they did have, it wasn’t smooth glass that had a really clear reflection. It was metal. Even the reflection, if they did see it, was distorted and sort of blurry. When they saw themselves even in a mirror in that day and age (the few times they might be able to see it), it didn’t leave a lasting impression on their hearts about what they looked like. They would see it, and it would be sort of blurry and distorted. Then they’d leave, and they’d walk away and forget because they weren’t seeing it often enough. They couldn’t keep the image with them. He is saying that is exactly what those who hear the Word and don’t do it are like. He says you gather with the church on Sunday. You hear the Word. You receive some moral or therapeutic comfort for about an hour, and then you walk out the door. As soon as you walk out the door like we’ll do in about 30 minutes… Some of us are going to do this tonight. We do it every week. Some of you have been listening to Matt for years, and every week you do this. You do this before we even celebrate the Lord’s Supper. Before the service is even over, you’re up. You’re gone, and you’ve forgotten (maybe before you even get out the door) what you’ve heard. This is what James is saying. He is saying you do this, and you completely forget. That word forget doesn’t just mean to not remember. It also means you discard. You purposely don’t give attention to it. You come, and you hear, and you leave. For the rest of the week until you gather again the next Lord’s Day or whenever it is, you forget and discard everything that’s been said. James is saying this doesn’t please God. If you think this pleases God, if you think you’re right with God because you come in here and you do that and then you leave and you forget it until you come back, then you are unbelievably deceived. That’s what he is saying! Then he gives the contrast in verse 25. He says, “But the one who looks into the perfect law…” The word law here is synonymous with the phrase Word of Truth. If you’ve been following about the phrase Word of Truth or Word in verses 18, 21, 22, 23, it’s sort of a driving motif through this whole section. This is a synonymous word for it that it’s… He is talking about the gospel. He is not talking about the Old Testament law. He is talking about the lordship of Jesus and the demands the lordship of Jesus makes on our lives (loving God with all of our heart, mind, soul, and strength, loving our neighbor as ourselves). That’s what he is talking about here. He is saying the one who looks into this Word of Truth, this gospel that compels us and demands we live life a certain way, which is actually a freeing way to live life… He says, “…the law of liberty…” It’s liberating to do that. The one who does that and perseveres in looking at it, “…being no hearer who forgets…” This is a different type of hearer. He is not a “…hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.” How that’s for a beatitude? This is the blessed man (Psalm 1). This is the man who has his roots set bounded by the stream who is ever flourishing because he has his life rooted in what God has done for him through his Son, through his life and his death and his resurrection in the gospel, in the Word of Truth, in this law of liberty he is talking about that he’ll come back to in chapter 2. This is what genuine faith looks like. He says this is what pleases God. True faithfulness is doing this. Again, you back up, and you go, “Okay, so what’s changed?” His point in all of this, church, is the same as Jesus’. Look at these two hearers (the one who hears and forgets and the one who hears and does). Examine yourself, and humble yourself before the Lord. Ask him to reveal where you’re at, and receive the Word of Truth. Let it rule you. Let it liberate you. This is what James is saying. Do what you’ve heard! Don’t be deceived! Are you deceived? If you are, I’m thankful you’re here. What God is saying is you shouldn’t be anymore. Know who you are before God, and humbly receive the Word of Truth. Of course, again, this is the very thing that is not happening in these churches, which is why James comes full circle in verse 26. Look at it.  He says, “If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person’s religion…” Religion is not a bad word like it is today. Religion then is faith. He is talking about genuine faith. That’s a synonym for religion. He says if anyone thinks he is religious and has genuine faith and he doesn’t bridle his tongue, he is right back to where he started, coming back down to the earth here. He deceives his heart. This person’s religion and faith are worthless. It’s not faith at all, which is where he is headed for the next three chapters. After getting to the heart of things, James comes back to the behavior, and he says this is why your day-to-day way of speaking… Listen, church. Our day-to-day way of speaking to our roommates, to our spouses, to our classmates, to our children, to our parents… He is concerned. He is looking at how they’re speaking out of an angry heart, and he is saying, “I don’t even know if you’re a Christian. I don’t care how many of the songs you have memorized or how much of the Scripture you’ve hidden in your heart. If you’re still speaking like this to people who are brothers and sisters or even enemies, you may not be a Christian. I’m really concerned…concerned enough to write this letter and tell you that multiple different ways.” This is unbelievably sobering what he is writing here. He is saying true faith… Verse 27. This is where he ends. “Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father [this good Father who has brought us forth out of his Word], is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.” The kind of faith that pleases this good Father who has brought us forth as a firstfruit, James says, is the faith that is bearing the fruit of love. We’ll come back to this verse next week, but a love for our neighbors (especially the most vulnerable of our neighbors) and a single-minded love and devotion to God, this is real faith. This is true faith, and it’s going to work itself out in a million different ways. But let’s just catch our breath, zoom out, and think together for a minute. You know, one of the pastoral tensions I (I know I don’t get to interact with you as much, but) just generally walk with (and maybe most pastors walk with) is the tension (especially when you’re preaching a sermon like this or from a text like this that calls us to examine our faith) of wanting the right people in the congregation to hear the right thing. In other words, with a passage like this, as much as it depends on me, what I’m wanting to do is to avoid causing true Christians (especially those of you who may be very vulnerable right now in your faith) from doubting when you don’t need to be doubting whether or not you have genuine faith. I want to avoid that. I want to comfort you and encourage you while simultaneously I actually want to very explicitly confront those of you who need to be confronted because you are deceived in the same way James is talking about. You think you’re a true Christian, but you’re not. I don’t know if that made sense, but that’s kind of the tension I always feel. I want to encourage the right people and confront the right people. That’s out of your control to some degree, but that’s always an angst you have when you’re up here. It’s sort of like my kids right now. There’s one of my daughters (and if you know my family, you would know which one) who, in terms of discipline, she is kind of internalizing the wrong things. It’s kind of sad, kind of funny at the same time. Somebody will wrong her (one of the other children or myself). We’ll wrong her. We’ll sin against her. When it comes time for the moment of reconciliation (we’re trying to model that from an early age), we’re bringing the offender (not the one who has been offended) to them to apologize. We’ll ask the offender, “Okay, what do you say?” My daughter who didn’t do anything will say, “I’m sorry.” You know, she’ll just jump out ahead of time and go, “I’m so sorry” while the one you’re trying to get that out of is just sitting there silently. They’re internalizing the wrong thing in this exchange. I don’t want that to happen. It’s like, “No! You shouldn’t be sorry. You didn’t do anything. You should be sorry, and the fact that you’re not, we’re going to go have another conversation.” You know? It comes back. But that’s kind of the tension you could feel when you walk through a letter or a passage like this where, okay, how do you know who is talking to whom here? Some of that you just have to leave to the conscience of the person who is standing before you. You want to be careful pastorally. What I thought would be helpful was just to maybe end with some questions we can all think through together and trust the Spirit of God here to minister to your hearts. Maybe just close the text if you have your Bible open. I just want to ask you a number of questions, and then we’ll transition. If you want to close your eyes, if that helps you listen… Sometimes it helps me listen. Are you a Christian? Thinking about you…not your spouse, not your friend, not the neighbor you brought. I’m talking about you. Are you a Christian? Are you one who has humbly received the gospel, the Word of Truth, about Christ? If the answer to that question is no, I would just follow and ask you, what’s keeping you even today from receiving and worshiping him? What’s the hurdle? I’d admonish you, I’d invite you, I’d encourage you, believe on Christ. He loves you. This good God, this perfect God, has made a way for you to be loved by him and to become his son or his daughter. He did it by making his only Son an enemy so you who are an enemy of God right now could become his son or his daughter. If you answered yes to the first question, if you answered, “Yes, I’m a Christian,” is this evidenced in your life? Would other godly people affirm that about you? Are you even willing to ask them? Does your daily life, professing Christian, characteristically speaking, align with your profession of faith? Are you a doer of the Word when you leave this room…maybe even before you leave this room every weekend? Would people in your family or on your team or at your job actually be surprised to learn you’re a Christian? If you told them you were a Christian, would they be surprised? Is there any chance that you’re self-deceived about what your relationship with God is? Any chance? Any chance that you might be the one who looks in the mirror and walks away and forgets what you see? Even if your answer to that question is no, I would just say, “Okay, then. If you’re pretty assured that you’re a believer, praise God. In what ways, Christian, are you not living in light of your identity and destiny as a firstfruit of God’s creation, God’s salvation?” In what ways are you trying to obey the law (which is not a bad thing…it’s actually a really beautiful thing)? You’re trying to obey the law without the beauty of God’s character and the beauty of the vision of who you are and where you’re headed in Christ as your motivation. Are you enslaved to anger like I was enslaved to anger and sometimes still am? Are you enslaved to your desires, your wants, what you perceive to be your needs? Are you controlled by your mouth instead of controlling your mouth? What are the areas in your life where, man, you’re saying you’re an apple tree, but you’re bearing oranges? Look to Christ whatever category you’re in. However you answered these questions tonight, look to Christ. This is the invitation. Take off those clothes. Look to Christ who stands ready to save you and love you, who has a table set before you, whose goodness and mercy want to follow you all the days of your life. Charles Spurgeon, preaching on this text, said this (and I’ll end with this tonight): “What would you say of a cook who prepared dinners for other people and yet died of starvation? Foolish cook, say you. Foolish hearer, say I. Are you going to be like Solomon’s friends the Tyrians, who helped to build the temple and yet went on worshiping their idols? Sirs, are you going to look on at the table of mercy and admire it, and yet refuse its provisions? Does it give you a thrill of pleasure to see so many taken from the highways and the hedges and brought in [to the family of God], and will you stand outside and never partake yourself? I always pity the poor little boys on a cold winter night who stand outside a steaming cook-shop window and look in and see others feasting, but have none themselves. I cannot understand you.” Why would you want that? “All things are ready, and you are bidden and persuaded [again tonight] to come, and yet you are content to perish with hunger. I pray you bethink yourselves, and I ask the Spirit of God to make you doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.” Jesus, we thank you that you are a high priest for us because you heard and you did everything your Father said. You did it all the way to death on a cross so we could be brought in, so we wouldn’t be left with our faces pressing against the window on a cold night outside of the bakery, but we could come in and taste the Bread of Life. Spirit of God, even as we just began tonight, where we are building our lives on sand, help us. Reveal that to us. Forgive us. Change us. Empower and teach us how to live in light of the identity and the destiny you have said is true of us. Continue to conform us into your Son, O God we pray, sons and daughters who hear and do, not just hear. We ask in Christ’s name, amen. Amen.    "
13,the-response-of-faith-repentance,0,"I couldn’t be more excited than to be here with you tonight. This is one of my very favorite parts of the week. Tonight we get to look at some of God’s precious truths. I will say on the front end that I do have a fear for many of us. I have a pastoral concern for many of us. I fear that, like me earlier in my life, you have never really heard the fullness of the gospel. The message we often hear of the gospel is full of the benefits of the gospel but often is incomplete in terms of what is required to be a Christ follower. I believe many of us have been brought up in a kind of cultural Christianity that I would argue is actually no Christianity at all. It’s more in line with the American dream than it is the call Christ calls us to. In these instances, as Matt alluded to in one of his recent messages, Jesus just becomes an add-on to our lives and doesn’t radically alter the trajectory of our lives. Tonight this message is called The Response of Faith: Repentance. Growing up, I’m not sure I ever heard the full gospel; it was incomplete. Maybe it was incomplete, or maybe it was just I couldn’t hear all the gospel was calling me to, but regardless, I remember being comforted by the fact that Christ died for my sins. I remember being just comforted by the fact that it was a free gift. It was something I could not earn; I could go to heaven because of what Christ did. Who wouldn’t want that, right? We could live eternally with God! I lived for the first 15 years of my adult life believing I was a Christian when the the gospel I had believed was merely a life insurance policy so I could continue to sin. I could continue to sin all the more so grace would abound. Paul, as he unpacks the gospel, says may that never be the heart of a believer. May that never be the heart of a believer that grace would be cheap, because grace is very costly, as we’ll look at tonight. I lived a life where I felt free to sin all the more. Paul goes on to argue. He says that’s even impossible for the believer because of something called regeneration. We’ve been given a new heart and new affections. It doesn’t mean we don’t sin. It means when we sin, our desire is to return to God, to be obedient to God. We have been given hearts that desire obedience. God still desires obedience out of his children, but the obedience goes from kind of “I have to” (“I have to be obedient to God”) to “I want to.” That’s evidence of God’s grace. That’s evidence he has changed our hearts; he has written his law on our hearts. The gospel is not only a comfort, but it is also a call to something so radically different and so countercultural that it is worth forsaking all the world values. In Mark 1:14b and 15, it says, “Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, and saying, ’The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.’” I want to orient us here for just a minute. Last week, we talked about this kind of high-level gospel view, the gospel from the air. We talked about creation. Remember? Then we talked about fall. Then we talked about redemption. Then we talked about consummation. This we want to look at from a little bit different angle, a little bit more personal angle, something you and I have to contend with personally. We’ve looked at God. We’ve looked at man. We saw last week the intervention of Christ. Now we’re going to look at how we are to respond to this glorious gospel, this good news that light has entered the darkness. Light has invaded the dark spaces. Now how are we called to respond to that glorious gospel? I would say evidence that faith has taken root in our hearts, that we have received the good news of the gospel, will lead us to repentance, to worship, to gratitude, to surrender, to love, and to obedience. This week our two primary texts will be Luke 15 in terms of fostering a better idea of what biblical repentance looks like. We’re going to compare that to what worldly sorrow looks like. Maybe you’ll tonight find yourself more on the worldly sorrow side, but God is here. He is among us. He is with us. He is shaping our hearts and leading us to a type of sorrow before God, a breaking of our hearts, a softening of our hearts so we might find life and peace, and we might not be stuck in that insanity we talked about last week. Before we get to that, before we get to Luke 15, the first thing I want to do is to try to reconcile something for us. My mentor in biblical counseling was a man named Jerry. He was really excited as he came into the office one day. I think he had overhead some sort of a radio program. He just had this visual contrasting these ideas, these two sides of God, of God’s mercy and God’s justice. How can a God be perfectly merciful and, at the same time, be perfectly just? I think the only way we can reconcile those two things is through the cross of Jesus Christ. I just want to give you just an illustration of what that might look like. In Romans 3:23, it says all of mankind is on a one-way track to death. That’s kind of where we spent our time two weeks ago. We saw the redeemed step one truth there. We are all on this one-way track. Unless someone intervenes, unless someone who has the power to break sin and to save us from death intervenes into this, this is the track we’re all on. But God has intervened through Jesus. I don’t want you to look at this as kind of a ladder. I want you to look at this as a track, a track leading to life through Jesus Christ. We see we were in our sin, and we see Jesus comes and offers a way to life as he lived a life we couldn’t live, a life of righteousness. Jesus says, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” We have this example of love in Jesus Christ as he comes and offers life. This mercy God has shown us through Christ… It says in Romans 2:4, “Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God’s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?” I think part of what this is saying is just because God is patient, just because he is kind, just because he has not been quick to anger, just because he has not wiped us out as a people, don’t think that means he doesn’t care. Don’t think just because he has not poured out his wrath on us he does not care about your sin. He cares! He cares so much that he would send his Son to the cross. Jesus cares so much about sin that he would go to the cross and lay his life down. There has to be something that happens here. Some will call this the great exchange, where Jesus becomes our sin. It says in 2 Corinthians 5:21, “For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin…” He becomes sin on our behalf. Guess what we get? We get his righteousness. Second Corinthians 5:21b says, “…so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.” That’s pretty cool that he would impute his righteousness to us, but there’s something that’s happening here. The question is how do we get on the other track? I think biblically (and I think there are two sides to the same coin) it’s called faith and repentance. You don’t get righteousness and just continue on the same track you’re on. It calls you to something radically different. I know some of you are really uncomfortable right now because I’m talking to you, but that’s okay. I pray God is speaking to your heart and leading you to something better. Acts 17. Remember when we finished up last week? It said, “The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.” God is commanding all people everywhere to…what?  To repent. Some of us oftentimes are offended by that word repent. I mean, only the self-righteous would go, “What do I have a need to repent for?” Right? We need to remember the commands of God. Remember back in Genesis 2 when God said, “Don’t eat of the fruit of the tree in the garden”? Right? The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. What is he trying to do? He is trying to preserve their lives. In the same way, this command is attempting to preserve our lives. It’s calling us to life. He is not withholding life from us; he is inviting us into it. Remember this cycle of insanity. When we left off, we said there’s this kind of remorse that comes after these injuries and pain, and there are two kinds of sorrow. There’s the kind of sorrow that will keep you perpetually stuck in this insanity and there’s the kind of sorrow that produces repentance without regret leading to salvation. There’s worldly sorrow and there’s godly sorrow. Second Corinthians 7:10: “For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death.” My hope is that God tonight would not allow one person here to leave regretful. I think in some sense, each one of us has landed here for one reason or another because of difficulties, because of suffering and sorrow. It wouldn’t just be worldly. God would grant repentance and life to those he has gathered here. We’re going to look at what is called the parable of the prodigal son. I’m going to borrow some language here and call it the parable of the two lost sons, because both sons in this parable are lost. We’re going to look first at the first part of Luke 15, verses 1 and 2. Then we’ll move into the parable. I know this probably has been a rich text for each of you as you were in the Word this week. Starting in verse 1, it says, “Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him. And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, ’This man receives sinners and eats with them.’” The first thing we just want to notice is the fact that there are both the sinners and tax collectors. That’s one group of people. Then you have the Pharisees and the scribes. You have the sinners, and you have the self-righteous. The second thing I want to point out just here right before we get into this particular parable is just the response, because we see in the parable of the lost sheep, the parable of the lost coin, and this parable similar responses. In the parable of the lost sheep in verse 7, it says, “Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.” Do you see what’s happening there? Joy in heaven. Rejoicing. We should never be ashamed to come home to God. Then we see in verse 10, “Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.” Then we turn our attention here to this parable. “And [Jesus] said, ’There was a man who had two sons.’” So this is a story about two sons. “And the younger of them said to his father, ’Father, give me the share of property that is coming to me.’” It’s interesting here (this younger son). I think this younger son has some idea of authority. This idea of authority that in his father’s house, under his father’s covering, come several things: provision, protection, the presence of his father, and direction. I think, just like in Christianity…you know, we talked about the benefits without the responsibilities…I think oftentimes in our culture, and even what I would call entitlement, is wanting the benefits without the responsibility. “I want the protection of…” Those of us who have teenage kids, oftentimes they want the benefits of living under their parents’ covering, but they don’t want the responsibility. They don’t want to answer to anyone. You know, those of you who have children that age. I think this young man has some idea of, “Hey, this is a package deal.” He realizes he cannot live under his father’s covering, under his father’s roof, and live the way he wants to live. This forces the son to make a decision. “You can either stay and live under my rules and my guidelines, or you can go.” We don’t see a lot of arguing by the father. The son shows he is really more interested in the father’s stuff than he is relationship with the father. In a way, he is saying, “I’m counting you as dead.” Right? First of all, you need to understand an inheritance is not earned. It’s something that’s bestowed upon you. To think you deserve that is just as kind of insane as thinking we deserve to go to heaven. You know? There is that idea that he is saying, “I want your stuff, but I don’t want you.” Then the question becomes, “Is the father enabling?” Because this has really provoked a lot of questions in me. What is enabling? First of all, I want you to know enabling is not enabling a person to get help. That’s not enabling in a bad way. That’s enabling in a good way. Enabling in a bad way, I think biblically, is allowing those you’re responsible for to continue to live under your covering without consequence when they’re being disobedient. Okay? That’s enabling, but that’s not what’s going on here with the father. He is saying, “If that’s what you want, then…” He doesn’t resist him. In a way, he preserves the relationship and gives him what is rightfully his even though he didn’t deserve it. He gives it to him, and having the means is going to expose his heart, what he really loves. It says, “And he divided his property between them. Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in reckless living.” I can remember in my life God giving me a great job, a job in which I was making a ton of money. Guess what it revealed? It revealed what I really loved, because that’s what I spent my money on. I squandered it. It says, “And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need.” Sin is costly. It will ravage your life. We see some desperation here in this young man. “So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.” Now this is a Jewish boy with unclean animals. He is pretty desperate. “And he was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything.” There’s a picture of longing for sin. That’s a picture from God’s perspective of sin. You are longing for the pods the pigs ate. No one is feeling sorry for this young man. No one is giving him anything to eat. This is his best thinking, his best decisions, in trying to find satisfaction apart from his father. This is where it’s landed him. He thinks he is in hog heaven, but he is not. He is in the pigpen. Listen. He is not a pig. He is a son! He’s not where he belongs. “But when he came to himself…” This is just a picture of repentance. It’s like suddenly this young man’s eyes are opened to the reality of his situation. “But when he came to himself, he said, ’How many of my father’s hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, ”Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants.“’” He is willing to get up. He will arise. He has a willingness to get up and to make it right, to accept whatever consequences come his way. He humbles himself as an unworthy servant. He is not entitled anymore. He doesn’t say, “You owe me this,” or, “You owe me that.” He had already squandered all he was entitled to. There was nothing left to claim. “And he arose and came to his father.” He didn’t just say, “I’m going to do it.” It wasn’t always, “This is what I’m going to do,” but actually it moved him. Faith is active. Faith without works is dead. It’s not just about saying you’re going to do something. It’s about actually taking a step of obedience in faith. It led him to action. “And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.” Look at the response of the father. He is watching! He is waiting! I mean, the son is still reeking from the pigpen, and he runs and gives him a big hug and he kisses him. “And the son said to him, ’Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’” Even before he can get it out, the father has heard enough evidently and interrupts him and says… “But the father said to his servants, ’Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.’” He is not looking for anything for himself personally out of this. He is not putting himself between his son and God and saying, “Oh yeah? Well, then you’re going to have to do this. You’re going to have to do this.” He receives him back. We see here just the provision of the father, just a picture of us coming home in Christ. This robe he is given is a robe of righteousness. It covers his filth, his shame. He is given a ring, and this ring is a representation that he belongs to this family. There’s belonging. Then we see the sandals for his feet. He is treated as he is as a son rather than a slave. He comes as a slave. He comes in humility, but he is blessed. Do you think he is grateful? You bet he is grateful. It says the father says, “’And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to celebrate.” I heard one guy talking about this. I agree with most of what he teaches, but one of the questions he asked is who did it cost the most for this son’s reconciliation with the father? I would say the calf. It cost the calf his life! Right? This shows us the seriousness of sin. I mean, somebody has to die. Reconciliation costs the life of an innocent calf, a fatted calf that is apportioned for many. Jesus was the Lamb of God who was sacrificed on our behalf that we might have reconciliation to the Father. We see the response to this repentance in celebration, but not all celebrate. Not the self-righteous, because it’s not fair. “Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant. And he said to him, ’Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.’” You would think there would be joy in this young man’s heart. “But he was angry and refused to go in.” What does his father do? “His father came out and entreated him…” He doesn’t want grace for his younger brother. He wants the law. His father entreats him to come in, to repent, and to join the party, to maintain relationship with the father, otherwise he might end up outside of the party. Then it says, “…but he answered his father, ’Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.’” First of all, look at the self-centeredness of this young man. “I served you. I never disobeyed. You never gave me…that I…with my friends.” He misses the fact that his brother, who was headed for destruction, is now home. Then look at his justification for his relationship with his father. He is self-justifying, right? His justification is in his own goodness, in his own obedience. How does he view the fatted calf? Just a young goat. He treats the sacrifice with disdain. He doesn’t value it. He doesn’t value the sacrifice, just like the self-righteous don’t value the sacrifice of Jesus. “’But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!’ And he said to him, ’Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.’” We don’t know how the older brother responds. We don’t know if he will remain outside of the party or if he will repent and come in and join the celebration. Let’s take a look here just with a table of what the difference between godly, grief-producing repentance and worldly grief looks like. On this left side, we can see godly grief is vertical where worldly grief is horizontal. Godly grief is a recognition of where I’ve been before God first and foremost. Remember in the story? He says, “I have sinned against heaven and before you.” Worldly grief is just grieved over my circumstances. “I got busted. I lost my wife. I lost my kids.” It’s not oriented around God. This godly grief is God- and others-focused, where worldly grief is self-focused. It wallows around in self-pity and says, “Poor me,” and lives kind of as a victim. Godly grief is spiritual, that God might grant us repentance. That’s what we’re praying for: God might grant us a softening of our hearts that we might experience a godly sorrow that would lead to life, where worldly grief is purely emotional. It’s not that godly grief is not emotional; it’s just that worldly grief is only emotional. Godly grief has a willingness to do whatever needs to happen. “I’ve been reconciled to the Father. My heart has been changed. If I have offended somebody, then I want to make that right.” See, we’ll learn later when we talk a little bit more about reconciliation that the gospel reconciles a heart in a way that the law can’t. The law can do it outwardly, but the gospel can transform a heart of injustice, where worldly grief is demanding. It’s, “I will do this, and I won’t do this. There are things I will and I won’t do.” Godly grief is active, and worldly grief is passive. As a pastor, these can be pretty revealing, because you can have somebody who comes in, and they confess a lot. But then when you say, “Okay, why don’t you go get involved in our Recovery ministry? Why don’t you go begin to live in biblical community and live that out?” there is a resistance to that or an all-out, “No, I won’t do that. There are certain things I will and I won’t do.” I’m not saying this is the place somebody has to go in order to experience repentance. It’s just are you willing to live the way God has called you to live, in open community and accountability and those sorts of things? Godly grief is hopeful. I mean, think about this. If I’ve been reconciled to God, if I have the most wonderful thing in the universe, the thing I should treasure above all things, whatever it cost me, then I’m without regret and having been broken in that moment. It doesn’t mean I don’t regret what has happened historically. It’s forward-looking. “I’ve been given grace.” Worldly grief is going to be hopeless. It’s going to be continually looking back to the good ol’ days, you know, as if being caught up in sin is a great… I mean, it’s the pigpen. It’s like looking at the pigpen and longing for the pigpen still. Godly grief, I think, and repentance, is going to lead us to gratitude. We’re going to be begrudging with worldly grief. Then godly grief is going to be perseverant, right? There’s something that’s been radically changed in me internally that shapes the way I live my life outwardly. I’m not saying I never sin again. I’m saying God begins to lead me out of that sin, lead me out of that slavery, where worldly grief is temporary. Why? Because there’s been no heart change. There’s been no heart change, and really what I’m doing is I’m waiting for everyone to stop looking at me so I can get back to what I really love. Godly grief is humble. I come as an unworthy slave, not demanding, taking responsibility, and accepting the consequences, where worldly grief is prideful, angry, avoids responsibility, blames, justifies, minimizes, and avoids consequences. We can see here that in that insanity cycle we were in before, we can do this through irreligious types of behaviors, and then we can do this with religious types of behaviors (what we might describe as counterfeit forms of redemption). That can be doing religious practices. It can be working steps apart from a gospel context. Apart from Jesus, it doesn’t matter what we do. Until God shines his light in our hearts and until he exposes that which we have been pursuing that is unfruitful and really reveals to us the life that is in Christ, we will continue repeatedly in this cycle. To those who are self-righteous who might not be able to understand those who are caught up in an irreligious-type cycle, Romans 2:1 speaks to that and says, “Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.” I can’t tell you how many times this has happened in my life, where I’ve judged somebody, and then I end up being that guy. How will you respond to your sin? Because we said this is personal tonight. How will you respond to your sin and God’s grace? Once we are saved, once we give our lives and surrender our lives to Christ and we say, “Okay, we’re in. We’re all in. Whatever it costs, I’m in,” then we can begin to move this idea of repentance counterclockwise. You know, instead of it being after the injuries and pain we experience this sorrow and then come back to Christ, perhaps here as we’re working around this, as we’re tempted in our flesh, then by action we turn to God rather than to our flesh. If you want to turn, you can really quickly to Romans, chapter 6. There in verses 12 and 13 it says, “Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions. Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.” Perhaps we catch it earlier, and it’s just in this thinking and obsessing stage. If you can flip over maybe a page or two to Romans 8:5-6 it says there: “For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.” Again, we’re just trying to learn how to war against this so when we realize when the Holy Spirit begins to show us what we’re thinking and obsessing on and when it’s not honoring to God, then, through the power of the Holy Spirit we can begin to look to him rather than to it for satisfaction, for redemption. Because all of these other forms are going to be counterfeit forms. Then we have 1 Corinthians 10:13-14, which says, “No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.” Just at that point of temptation, God provides a way out. Sometimes we don’t recognize (or we ignore, I think, is a better way) the Holy Spirit. We say, “No, I can handle this. I’m going to allow myself to continue around this cycle. I think I can stop it before it gets out of hand.” It’s kind of that idea of having a pet rather than killing the lion. Then we can have that desire for relief. Remember it starts off with irritable, restless, and discontent. We can have that desire for relief. In Galatians it tells us that part of the fruit of the Spirit is peace. Maybe it’s before I even get out the door that I go hit my knees and I settle my heart before the Lord before I go out and I start making a mess of my life and of the lives of others. Some games people play… This was a sermon series I would recommend to you that Matt did (Games People Play). These aren’t the examples he gave, but one of the ways we play games is we suppress the truth. Romans 1:18 says, “For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.” We avoid. We avoid difficulty. We just avoid sorrow. We just kind of always try to live elevated and pretend like nothing is wrong. We don’t allow ourselves to get honest with God and really allow our hearts to be soft and broken before him and to confess where we really are. Another way we try to play this game without genuine repentance is we try to cover it up. Isaiah 64:6 says, “We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment.” Our attempts to clean ourselves up through our good works are to no avail. It’s kind of like this idea that, “I messed up, so I’m going to go balance this out. Then I’ll approach God once I kind of get clean.” That’s not the gospel. That’s never going to fix the problem. Another way of doing this is by serving penance. This is just living under the law. This isn’t repentance; this is penance. This is when I do something wrong, I beat myself up. Once I’m finished beating myself up, then all of a sudden, I’m justified. Now I can stand before God again. That’s the law. That’s not grace. That’s not the gospel. Galatians 2:21 says, “I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.” If you could get there from here by doing that, then Christ had no reason to die. Another way we often play is we hide through labels, through psychological labels. We explain our behavior, our ungodliness, because we have some sort of psychiatric disorder. I’m not saying there’s not a legitimacy to psychiatric disorders, but what that can do sometimes is we blame that and therefore, “I’m not responsible.” If we’re not responsible for our sin, then we’ll never repent. “I am the way I am because I have this disorder. So I’ll never grow spiritually.” We’ll look at some of that in a couple of weeks. Now I want to talk to you just in summary to how we got to where we are right now. I want to talk to you quickly about something called the fear of the Lord. Scripturally, “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.” That’s what Proverbs tells us. It’s good to understand what the fear of the Lord is. That’s Proverbs 1:7. It says, “…fools despise wisdom and instruction.” One easy way for me to remember the fear of the Lord is being right-sized before God. That means I need to understand who I am before God, and I need to understand who he is. I am small, and he is big. One time I was counseling a young man who spent a lot of time on the Internet. He was telling me about how much he knew. I said, “How much of what is on the Internet do you know? I mean, you’re like 14. You sound like you know a lot.” He said, “Well, I probably know about 60 percent.” I was like, “That is phenomenal! That’s unbelievable. Let’s test that out. There’s this thing called WeatherBug on my computer.” This was like, I don’t know, 8 or 10 years ago. I said, “I can get on there, and I can tell you what the weather is of any little city around. Here we are in Flower Mound. I know you’re from Plano, but in Flower Mound, what’s the temperature outside right now.” He was like, “It’s about 85.” I was like, “No, what’s exactly the temperature? What’s the wind speed? What’s the barometric pressure? Do you know what? I can get on the Internet right now and tell you what those things are, but maybe it’s because this isn’t your city. What is it in Plano? Okay, you don’t know. What is it? Maybe it’s just you haven’t had a chance to study it yet. What was it yesterday?” You know, he says, “I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know.” “This is what’s on the Internet. Do you know what? Gosh, there’s a lot of information on the Internet, but do you know what? It doesn’t compare to what the knowledge of God is. You know very little. You are bound by your senses. You can’t see…” I mean, we’re in a counseling office. “You can’t see outside of these walls. You can’t tell me what’s going on in the parking lot. You can’t tell me who is there. Guess what? God can. The Internet can’t tell you that. Not only can he tell you that (what’s happened today, yesterday, a hundred years ago), but he can tell you what’s going to be tomorrow, the next day, and so on. From that standpoint, why would you ever make a decision on your own if he knows and you don’t know?” “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom…” I want to look quickly at just a picture of this in Scripture. I want to look at Isaiah 6. I think when we understand the love of God against the fear of the Lord, you’re going to see what this is going to lead to. Starting in verse 1: “In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.  And one called to another and said: ’Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!’ And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.” As he saw the Lord sitting on his throne, he says, “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!” We just see this, the majesty of God. Christ sitting on the throne. “Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth and said: ’Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.’” See that grace? See that love? Then we see Isaiah’s commission from the Lord. “And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ’Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?’ Then I said, ’Here I am! Send me.’” That’s his response. “You have been so gracious to me. I’m all in. I’m yours. You tell me what you want, and I’m yours.” Faith in God will lead us to repentance, will lead us to submission, will lead us to obedience, will lead us to gratitude, and will lead us to love. The last thing we’ll see here is a song by David Crowder that I just love. I love Bleecker. I also love David Crowder. Right here this is just an awesome song that kind of contrasts the difference between who I am and who he is and what he has done. It’s going to lead us to this idea of submission and freedom and life. It says, “I am full of earth, and you are heaven’s worth.” He is singing to God. He is acknowledging what he is made of. He is saying… You are heaven’s worth. I am stained with dirt, prone to depravity. You are everything that is bright and clean, The antonym of me. You are divinity, But a certain sign of grace is this: From a broken earth, flowers come up, Pushing through the dirt. You are holy, holy, holy, All heaven cries, “Holy, holy God!” You are holy, holy, holy. I want to be holy like you are. You are everything that is bright and clean, And you’re covering me with your majesty. And the truest sign of grace was this: From wounded hands redemption fell down, liberating man. But the harder I try, the more clearly can I feel The depth of our fall and the weight of it all. And so this might could be the most impossible thing Your grandness in me making me clean. Glory, hallelujah! Glory, glory, hallelujah! So here I am, all of me, finally everything Wholly, wholly, wholly, I am wholly, wholly, wholly, I am wholly, wholly, wholly yours. There’s a pause, and he says, “I am full of earth and dirt and you.” David Crowder comments on this song. He says, “And so, like any good country song, the punch line comes at the end with such a simple turn of phrase that is the difference between life and death, decay and newness, winter and springtime.” Father, we thank you for your Word. We thank you for the offer of life. Lord, we pray as we look to you in all your majesty, in all your glory, we understand just the great lengths you have gone to love and pursue us and to pay everything it would cost for us to come home. Just as you are there waiting for us to come home, we would not stand outside of your kingdom, demanding like an entitled person and say, “We want the benefits without coming under your authority,” but tonight we would see life comes from living with you, and you are the treasure. Those of us who have been far off, I pray you would lead us home, and we would fully give our lives all in. We would push it all in tonight, and we would follow you regardless of the cost. It’s in Jesus’ name I pray, amen."
14,a-culture-of-repentance,0,"Good evening. How are y’all doing this evening? I’m glad to be able to hang with you guys for the weekend. My name is Eric Mason, lead pastor at Epiphany Fellowship, and I am honored to be here tonight at The Village Church here in Flower Mound. Words can’t express our gratitude for the partnership God has developed between this church and Epiphany Fellowship, where I pastor in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, over the last five years now. It’s been five years of partnership. We can give God a hand praise for that can’t we? Yeah! We just recently started a basketball league for at-risk youth in our neighborhood in our city. We’ve gotten to the point where kids are bringing 10 or 15 kids with them a week, so we had to put a cap on what God is doing with that. What’s crazy about it is, because Philadelphia is a predominantly Islamic city, even above Christianity, it’s wonderful to see even Muslims are coming, bringing their children. It’s just an interesting dynamic by which we have a great opportunity to develop some common ground with what the Lord is doing to be able to lead some people to Christ who we wouldn’t normally have common ground with. The resources you have given and you have allowed us to partner with you with and you are partnering with us with have been a phenomenal, phenomenal help. The next partnership we’re going to be looking at with you guys for this next summer, which we’re excited about this summer coming up, is a team (a group) is coming from The Village and spending a month with us while we do our first summer youth program. If you could keep that lifted up in prayer, it’s going to be… Amen. I heard somebody clapping. Amen. It’s a really good time for us to connect and engage families in a neighborhood where it’s 75 percent single‑family homes. This is going to be great. This will be some of the greatest interaction, to be able to share Jesus with them, to serve them, to love them, and to even learn from them and see how God takes lives from spiritual death to spiritual life and from spiritual infancy to spiritual maturity. Amen, somebody? Amen. Let’s pray. Then we’re going to dive right into this text. Father, we thank you for the rich nature of the gospel. Lord God, I’m honored to know and to be in a relationship with you. That’s where we are. We are honored to be in a relationship with you. God, as we dive into a very difficult yet hopeful, because of Jesus, subject, will you allow our hearts and minds to be open and our souls to be open to everything you have to say to us? Teach us in this particular area of our lives how the renewing power of the gospel brings unadulterated hope to those who believe it. Let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O God, our strength, our Redeemer, in whom we trust. In Jesus’ mighty name… Everybody who agreed with that said, “Amen.” Turn with me in your Bibles to Psalm 51. We won’t be able to do this entire psalm. It would take me probably three or four weeks to just work through it, so we’re only going to deal with a portion of it. As you’re turning there, why don’t you stand? It’s a tradition of mine. I just like when we read the Scriptures that the people of God stand. Y’all don’t mind if I get a little bit traditional do you? All right. Just a little something something. I have a little old-school tinge in my back pocket I like to pull out every now and then, so love on your boy just for five minutes with this. We’re going to go from verse 1 to verse 6. Psalm 51. I’m going to read out of the ESV. It says, “Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin! For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgment. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me. Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being, and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart.” I want to tag this text with this subject just for a little while: the characteristics of a deeply repentant culture. You may be seated. If anything in our world is ever going to change, it has to have a culture of repentance built into the fabric of that particular aspect of culture. Repentance is a reoccurring theme ever since the fall that God has been demanding from human beings when we, not just by our nature but also by our activities, actions, and associations, would come to a point where we’re being willing to repent of our sins. Without repentance built into the fabric of any aspect of culture, what will begin to happen is a lethargic sense of life will build in and there will be embedded in it a level of compromise that God, by his holiness, will see as sinfulness in left field of his glory and his passions and his praise. In any culture, when repentance is not a requirement at the bedrock and at the central piece of it, people will begin to see things that are extremely against the will of God as a part of the normal matrix of a culture. I’ve been given the task, kind of, of talking about racial reconciliation tonight, but to be honest, I actually don’t like to talk about racial reconciliation because I think many times when we talk racial reconciliation we come to the table and we begin to talk and different ethnicities begin to discuss issues concerning racial reconciliation. What begins to happen is people get to arguing and then walk away with no systemic change on any level. Right now you can take a deep breath because you don’t have an angry black man in front of you. Some of you are like, “Oh, we about to get it tonight. Oh, my God! As black as he is, as bald as his head his, good God Almighty! Let me brace myself.” You can take a sigh of deep breath a little bit. I want to talk about an overarching theme I think is much larger than racial reconciliation. To me, racial reconciliation is really a symptom of a larger issue that needs to be discussed. The larger issue that needs to be discussed is repentance. The issue with repentance is both the people who have been sinned against many times need to repent just as much as the people who sinned need to repent. We need the Spirit of the living God, people of God, to build a larger, overarching culture of repentance in the church, because when that culture, by the Holy Spirit, is built into the fabric of the church you automatically will have sin issues dealt with because there is a willingness for people to see the massiveness of God’s holiness but also a willingness to see the destitute nature of the sinfulness of man and all of the ways the sinfulness of man makes itself up in all of these different sin types. Then what happens is when you see the holiness of God and a sin is made clear to you, you expeditiously repent of it and you’re willing to work through all of the difficulties that come with repentance. Why? Because church is messy. Folk are messy. Small groups in community are messy. Listen. You and me? Guess what we are, too. Messy. Yeah, you’re with me. Because we’re messy, we need someone who took on our mess to redeem us from our mess. Then, after he has brought us into relationship with the living God (that is Jesus), now we progressively become less messy through the process of building a culture of repentance. As we come here to this passage, to me this is the bedrock passage in the Bible on repentance. He doesn’t say “repentance” one time in the passage. He doesn’t use the Hebrew word nacham any time in the passage, nor in the Septuagint do the translators use the word metanoeo one time in the passage. But one sniff of the culture of the heart of this broken dude right here before the holiness of God in the mire of his sin, you get the sense and the reality of the fact that repentance has taken place. Just a few things as we get in the text on this idea of repentance. Repentance is the willingness to feel remorse and self-reproach for what one has done to fail in reflecting and living out God’s standards. Repentance is to feel remorse (this is in the Old Testament), contrition, and self-reproach for the fact you have offended a holy God. In the New Testament, repentance means to change your mind the way you think things should be and embrace God’s. One of Jesus’ first messages was a message he took from John the Baptist. He just preached the same sermon. He said, “Metanoeo, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” In other words, he said, “Repent from the way you think things should be and embrace the way God wants things to be.” We come to the psalmist as he’s written this passage on really an ode to restoration and reconciliation with God and with man. David has been hanging out and enjoying the spoils of being a beasty leader and king for the living God. One day, as he sent his troops out to fight, he was chilling in the palace. Do you know what I’m saying? Hanging out enjoying his time in the palace. Kicking it. Do you know what I’m saying? Eating different types of spiced lamb and all different types of things. Enjoying himself. Sipping on a little something here and there. Then he gets up… I don’t know if he got up from the bed where he was sleeping. I don’t know if he had on his robe or he had on his tunic. I don’t know if he had on his sandals. I don’t know if he had his crown cocked to the side, but he walked out and he looked over his kingdom. He folded his arms, looking around. All of a sudden he said, “Wow! Hey! Yo, yo, yo, yo! Can somebody come here for a second? Go get Shorty right there for me.” In other words, he went, in the midst of this time of a great height of enjoyment, and told them to go get a little honey for him. When he got her, he went through… You know the story, some of you. He killed her husband to cover up the fact she was pregnant and that he had laid with her. Nathan came to him, jammed him up as a beasty dude who stood toe-to-toe with him like, “You’re wiling.” After he told him, “You’re wiling,” he said, “Boom!” Then he was hurting. Then he went and eventually in probably a 24-month period wrote this psalm, which brings me to my first point. If you’re going to build characteristics of repentance in the culture, especially in the church that is supposed to be the main state of repentance… 1. You must throw yourself on the character of God. Look at the text. He said, “Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love…” Then he says, “…according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.” Then he says, “Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin!” I like this because David, throughout this passage, is deeply acquainted with the character of God. Without understanding the character of God, you won’t want to walk in repentance. Why? Because our normal stance when we wile out and sin against the living God is we want to run, because we think God is going to ultimately and unadulteratedly take us out. What David does is he knows something about the living God that is powerful. He knows something about the living God that is beautiful. One of the statements they used to say in the Old Testament was “the Lord God, maker of heaven and earth, full of loving kindness and abundant in mercy, slow to anger and abundant in forgiveness,” so he understood that more than just a cliché, he understood that as a part of the character of God. Because of his understanding of the character of God, it drove him to a desire based on being jammed up and based on sin that he did getting put in his face that he wanted to repent of his sin. What’s beautiful about it is he says, “Have mercy on me…” The word mercy here is an interesting word. It means really two things here. It means, “God, don’t give me what I deserve,” and “If I’m in the midst of what I deserve, can you make sure I don’t get as much as I deserve as you could give me?” I don’t know about you, but some of you have blown it. Some of you have been at a place in your life where you have blown it in a difficult way and you did not want to go before God because you had a faulty theological construct about who he is. But a person who understands repentance, a person who has been brought into a relationship with God through Jesus Christ bombards the throne of grace and is willing to not have the gap between their fellowship with God destroyed and infringed upon to the point where they say, “Whatever I have to do, I’m going to recognize what God is like, I’m going to recognize what I’m not like, and I’m going to throw myself on the mercy of the Covenant Keeper to bridge the gap between me and him.” That’s the first place of repentance. Repentance doesn’t start with sin. It starts with God. If you look at your sin, you’re going to get really depressed. You’re going to get really, really depressed. When you look at yourself… “I’m so sinful.” When you look at that and you stare into that long enough, you’re going to need all kinds of medicine. You’re going to need all kinds of help. Why? Because you are going to be in deep pain because your sin can only take you to your sin, not beyond it. David, before he got to his sin, went before the living God who can deal with his sin. Then he said, “Show me mercy in this way. There are two ways I want you to show me your mercy.” He said, “The first way which encompasses (both ways, really) is… I want you to do it according to your steadfast love.” I like that. There are two ways God can deal with your sin. Because of David’s sin, he deserved death. He had two counts on him. As a matter of fact, there were three counts: conspiracy, adultery, and murder. He had three counts of death chasing after him, but I don’t think he was going to go before God and say, “Lord, give me what I deserve in relation to my sin.” I don’t think he wanted those three counts. I know if I got a chance of getting off on something that was going to tear my life up, I’m going to ask God for some help on it. He didn’t throw himself on the holiness of God in relation to the anger of God being responsive to his wrath because of his hatred of his sin. That’s not the aspect of the character of God he called on, family. The aspect of God’s character he called on was his checed. He said, “I know you’re going to deal with that yourself, but God, I need you to deal with that this way. I need your steadfast love.” That steadfast love is a beautiful term, because it means God’s loyal love toward his people. It means his covenant loyalty. David is calling on this aspect of God’s character as a means to continue unbroken fellowship and communion with the living God, because God’s character of loyalty was most present in sending Jesus Christ for us to die on the cross for our sins. Just as in our sin we are called to the cross, so also in our sin we must entreat the Lord to remember the cross in light of our sin. Did you get that? That’s very, very important for us to understand. Then he says, “…according to your abundant mercy…” He goes further, and he begins talking. “Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin!” Because of his willingness to acknowledge who God is, now he can begin talking about and asking God, not just confessing his sin, not just repenting of his sin, but asking God, “Can you cleanse me of my sin?” 2. You must fully own the extent of your own sin. This is beasty right here. Look at what David says in verse 3. He says, “For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.” This idea of the Hebrew understanding of “I know” is beautiful here. It points to the idea of knowing something intimately. What David is saying is he was intimately knowledgeable of his sin. At one point he was blind to the reality of his sin. You and I cannot repent unless you are generally and specifically clear on the sinfulness of your sin. Many of us don’t like to look at our sin because we like to rush people beyond the impact of what our sin had on them. David is saying, “I know my sin in this instance. I know what my sin is in relation to your holiness, but I also know the challenges it caused the people around me.” The repentant must understand the shrapnel and collateral damage their sin caused those around them. That’s very, very important. When you build a repentant culture, people are willing to recognize and hear hard truths from anybody around them based on the sin they’ve committed. You can’t say, “I don’t want to hear that any more. I’m not feeling all of that.” When you’re like that when somebody jams you up about your sin, guess what you are. Unrepentant. When you know the depth of the raggedy trash you put on somebody’s life and the hell you put somebody through, it gives you what David will talk about later: a sense of brokenness. When the gospel is challenging and shaping your heart from your sin, it makes your heart malleable, and it makes you willing to hear some of the most difficult things you don’t want to hear. Many times, we say, “Well, God has forgiven me. You should forgive me.” Listen. There is no where in the Bible where the offender demanded they be forgiven. Show me the verse from Genesis to Revelation. “You’d better forgive me. Do you know what I’m saying? If you don’t forgive me, I don’t know what God is going to do. I repented. I fell back from my sin. Now you ought to forgive me.” No. When you demand forgiveness versus asking for forgiveness, you have a twisted understanding of your sin, the holiness of God, and the impact your sin had on someone else. When you build a culture like that, you have to be willing to hear what everybody has to say and how badly it hurt people, how much it challenged people, how much it hurt. Even if you are benefiting off the sins of someone else and they’re pouring out to you about the impact of that sin and you try to downplay the level of impact that sin had on somebody, it is extremely important for you to recognize that. I had a family member who is like a man’s man type of dude. Do you know what I’m saying? A fixed car type of dude. A carpenter type dude. Do you know what I’m saying? Knock you out, shotgun under the… Do you know what I’m saying? A thirty-aught-six up under the bed type cat. A three-generation-ago type dude still living. Rugged. Heart attacks. Cancer survivor. All of that coming up, saying, “Hi. I’m good.” Do you know what I’m saying? During the course of his life, he has a wasteland of people he’s crushed. I’m talking about blocks of people who his unredemptive form of manliness has hurt. When people come to him to say, “JoJo, I just want to holler at you for a second and let you know you really did some messed up stuff to me.” “I don’t want to hear all that.” He just goes off on them. Over and over and over again, there’s this impenetrable fortress of a wall around his pride that is infecting and challenging his ability to have a deeper sense of oneness with God and a deeper sense of intimacy and oneness with others. What is the impenetrable fortress within your life that makes you extremely afraid to look at your sin and to examine what people are saying about you in light of the living God? When JoJo looks back in his past and he looks back on his childhood, there are some things that happened to JoJo that he has never gotten over: father leaving, having to work to support the house before he was a teenager, and not finishing junior high school. All of these different things… Jim Crow South impacting him and his anger at seeing his uncle killed, his mom treated in a particular way by a white man. All of this impacted him and challenged him, and now he has a vast amount of chips on his shoulder. He went to two wars and came back: Korean War and World War II. He came back with two Purple Hearts. When he got the two Purple Hearts, he got called nigger and threw them in the trash. What he’s done is he’s taken this arsenal of offenses against himself and he’s become angry. Instead of taking that anger to God, what he’s done is internalized that anger. In internalizing that anger, anger that ferments is bitterness. That’s why God says in Hebrews, chapter 12, “Don’t become unbelieving like Esau who became embittered.” It said, “The root of bitterness sprouting up defiles many.” There it is. What happens is you could have been sinned against in your life, but because you didn’t allow the Holy Spirit and the gospel to deal with that particular sin, you develop an entitlement mentality because you believe you’re entitled not to forgive, because somebody didn’t give you an opportunity to deal with the issue. “I’m not going to deal with my mess because God won’t deal with their mess. I am going to build a fortress around me where I will never, ever acknowledge anything I’ve done until God deals with the pain from my past that I’ve gone through.” Some of you are right smack dab in that. What that is doing is it’s holding you hostage from calls of God on your life. It’s holding you hostage from new seasons from God. It’s holding you hostage from blessings from God. It’s holding you back from fellowship with God. Some of you, it’s holding you hostage from you loving your children like God wants you to love them. It’s holding you back from loving your wife like God has called you to love her. It’s holding you back from trusting pastoral leadership. It’s holding you back from being in community. It’s holding you back in so many areas of your life. But God is calling you to say, “I want you to allow me, no matter what happened to you, to get out of the way that impenetrable fortress so you can see me and I can show you you. When you see me and I show you you, you will know me, and I will know you, but I want to deal with your sin. I don’t want to leave you in your sin. That’s why I sent my Son, so you wouldn’t have to live in your sin, but that he could become sin on your behalf. I didn’t send Christ to ignore sin.” God is very confrontational. God is not a passive God. The core of the gospel is God’s willingness to confront the sinfulness of sin through Jesus Christ. When we don’t confront the sinfulness of our sin but are willing to confront the sinfulness of someone else’s sin we’re not walking in a gospel-centered life. You can talk gospel until you sound like a rooster or a chicken, but if you don’t deal with your own sin in your life and allow God… David said, “I know my sin.” He said, “I know it too well, God, but I know you, also, and I want you to deal with my sin, living God.” David walks through and continues with the reality of dealing with his sin, but also, one of the things he knew he couldn’t do…it’s interesting…was rush people to a speedy recovery of the hurt and pain he caused. One time, David and his boys were walking along through some fields and they were doing their thing. They were chilling. Walking. One dude was like, “David, look at you now, you bum! Look at you! You’re all about the kingdom. Where’s your crown now, dog? You ain’t got no outfit no more. Your boys are walking out of the kingdom. Your son is up there with all your concubines and your wives. Where is that now, David?” Joab said, “David, let me smash this dude right now. I’ll take his head clean off. Just one swing and he’d be gone.” David said, “Hold it. Fall back, Joab.” He said, “This may be the Lord rebuking me. I know God has forgiven me of my sin, but the impact of my sin doesn’t mean I’m not forgiven. It’s just a reminder of the impact I’ve caused. Let God deal with it.” A repentant person, even though they know they’re forgiven, still recognizes the consequences of their sin have affected people. That’s the power of living a forgiven life. God doesn’t let the consequences dictate whether or not you’re forgiven. It’s a reminder of the fact that sin does cause death, but you can still in the midst of that death walk in beautiful life in Jesus Christ. You can’t rush anybody out there. That’s why Hebrews 3:13 talks about and warns us of the deceitfulness of sin that causes a massive, hardening effect on the hearts of God’s people. He says, “Against you, you only, have I sinned…” He’s not disregarding his impact on man. That’s not what he’s doing. He’s basically pointing to the fact that, ultimately, his sin can be traced to be against the God of heaven and whose throne in which his sin is against. In other words, he’s taking responsibility for his sin. Then he goes further as he says, “…and my sin is ever before me.” This is crazy because David held on to his sin for a year. When he slept with Bathsheba…it’s crazy…he slept with her in this month, but Nathan didn’t walk up on him and jam him up until a year later. David was sitting on his sin. When David is writing Psalm 51, he says, “…and my sin is ever before me…” It’s a grace from God when you’re convicted of your sin. The reason why that’s a grace from God is because God’s grace is the only thing that can let you know how messed up you are and you be able to sense it. Be very afraid when you no longer feel the fact that you’ve sinned. Be very afraid when you can’t sense the grief of the Spirit. Be very, very afraid when you can shake off the conviction of the Holy Spirit bidding you not into condemnation, but bidding you into repentance. David sensed that, and he said, “…and my sin is ever before me…” He said, “God, for the last year my sin has been ever before me. It’s been all over. I know I did it. No one else knows I did it except for a few people who know I did it. I’ve kept this secret with a small crew of people.” I know we don’t do that, but he had a small group of people who knew the real deal. He’s out front trying to act like everything is okay. Righteous judging and talking all kinds of theological smack when there’s a small group of people who know the hypocrisy of David for that year. He’s grieved about it. He’s challenged by it. He said, “…and my sin is ever before me…” He said, “But it’s deeper than my life.” He said, “Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgment. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.” What David is doing is a full-run confession of his sin and dealing with his sin issues. One of the things that’s very, very important in building a culture of repentance wherever you are is not talking a whole bunch when it’s time to confess and repent of your sin before people. The Bible says in Proverbs 10:19, “When words are many, transgression is not lacking, but whoever restrains his lips is prudent.” When you have to go into a soliloquy… “I know I was wrong. I was wrong, but you have to understand.” See? You’re wiling out now. Now you’re trying to justify your sin instead of just dealing with it. “You know, back in the day, man, the way I was treated by my…” No. That has nothing to do with what we’re talking about right now. When Nathan said there was a man and he had a few sheep and this dude came and took them, David was like, “Kill them! Destroy them! Kill them! Where is he? Bring him before me. I’ll do it.” Nathan said, “You’re the man.” He says six words: “I have sinned against the Lord.” That was it. The refreshing nature… What’s beautiful about being in Christ is, “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” The Bible says if any man says he doesn’t have sin, he’s a liar and the truth ain’t in the vicinity of him. That’s what the text says. Eric Mason translation on the last part. The truth isn’t in them, but then it says, “But if [we] sin, we have an advocate with the Father...” When you experience the truth of Jesus Christ’s death on the cross, it frees you up to stop being phony. That impacts everything, which David moves to. 3. It causes you to long for real transformation. This is dope. This is beautiful stuff. The next thing David says in verse 6 is, “Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being, and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart.” That is rich. That is rich information there. This word delight is interesting. It means to take pleasure in something. To be eager, to have a fondness or affection toward an object is to experience emotional passion in someone, something, or some place. This delight may be felt by, of course, God or men. David is saying, “You delight. You have a passion for something in particular.” He says it right after this. This word I had to do some digging on, but it’s beautiful. The word truth here is interesting, because him delighting in truth in the inward being… The inward being is the place we have locked away from God. That’s what the inward being is. I’m going to talk about truth in a second, but the inward being is the place in your life where you have said, “God, you can have this little area right here.” This area is like when somebody comes in your house and you say, “Make yourself at home,” but you don’t really mean that. Do you know what I’m saying? That doesn’t mean, “Go up in my bed, and start pulling your toe fungus out. That’s making yourself at your home, not at my home.” We have limitations on that. When he said, “…you delight in truth in the inward being…” he is saying, “God, I want to let you in every single place in my life. Lord, I want you to be in these particular places because you want truth there.” This is where truth is interesting. It’s not just theological information. It’s a result of having it there in the realest sense of having Scripture and the Bible in particular areas of our lives. At the heart of the meaning of the root is the idea of certainty. The root form of the word is interesting. It means the concept of having support. Support is used in the sense of the strong arms of a parent supporting a helpless infant. In this form used here, pulling that in with it, it means to cause surety or certainty, stability, faithfulness, fidelity, appropriateness, probability, and all in all integrity of mind and authenticity. In other words, God desires the right information and the right disposition in the places we’ve closed off from him. At Epiphany Fellowship, we have one building. Y’all have like 10, but we have one building. Man, this is funny. Whenever the guy comes in and deals with all of our pest problems, he says, “I need you to open up every door here.” He says, “I need you to go around the building. I need you to make sure I can exterminate in every sector of this facility, because I can deal with just this part you guys meet in, or I can deal with the kitchen, but if you don’t open all of the doors, what’s in this area of the building that is infested can get into the other parts of the building and absolutely begin to bring the destruction in this part of this building (these rodents, these devourers) into other areas of the facility. I need you to open up everything.” That’s what God is saying to you tonight. God is saying to you tonight, “Open up everything all the way from the back, all the way up to the front, all the way up to the stage, all the way to the booth, on whatever campus that is going to be listening to this.” You are going to have to open up every single solitary area of your life as you grow in Jesus Christ. You must begin to get used to, “God, I opened this door. I don’t know how it smells in there. God, this is like one of those refrigerators that the electricity got turned off and the food got left in there.” What’s beautiful about God is mess doesn’t surprise him. No mess you or I deal with surprises him. Actually, he loves us so much he sent his Son to exterminate the planet of sin. That’s why he sent him. When he comes back, the part of the planet that is still touched by the deceitfulness and destruction of sin will be thrown in the lake of fire. Second Peter 3 says the rest of creation that is unredeemed will be burnt with intense heat, but the only people who will be able to remain and the only thing that will be able to remain is that which is in the Lord Jesus Christ. Some of you, now it’s time for you. You’re sitting beside someone who you know they’ve made a profession out of not being honest about their life. Some of you are professionally evasive in relationships. Tonight is the time to say, “God, I have been fearing this area of my life for a very, very long time. I’m going to open it up. This is it. I’m going to open this area of my life.” What does that have to do with racial reconciliation? Everything. I didn’t want to deal with racial reconciliation. If we deal with our unwillingness to deal with sin, then other sins that come up when the culture of repentance by the power of the Holy Spirit is created in our lives, what begins to happen is the person who is living under white supremacy or living under white privilege or the ethnic minority who is constantly waving the fist of victimization… When all the groups deal with their sin, their sinfulness, before a holy God, then it makes it much easier to talk about somebody else’s sin. When the sinfulness of somebody else’s sin is all you can see, then you don’t see the sinfulness of your own sin, because the sinfulness of your own sin before a holy God makes you level the playing field and say, “All sin is equal even though I’ve been hurt, or even though this person keeps throwing this in my face.” When the sinfulness of sin is dealt with in each one of our lives, guess what? We can tackle a whole bunch as a church. Some of y’all have the plastic look on. I’m not talking about surgery. I’m talking about you know. You have the plastic look. You’re always chipper and skipping and happy, and your life is rugged for real, for real. There is going to have to come a time in your life when you one day tell someone when they ask you how you’re doing, you say, “My life is a mess. I’m hurting and I’m struggling. I need some help.” When you build a culture of repentance, nobody is trying to impress anybody. Nobody is cool anymore. Nobody can one-up everybody, because we know we’re all a mess but for the grace of God. We know we’re all in a difficult position but for the grace of God. When we look at the holiness of God and we look at the sinfulness of ourselves and we look at the glory of the cross of Jesus Christ and how he dealt with our sin and satisfied God’s holy standard, when we come to the cross and look at the glory of the resurrection, we’re on a level playing field. Now we can talk without us wanting to punch each other out about the issues we don’t like culturally or ethnically or economically about each other. Why? Because we’re just a bunch of different-looking sinners who are in need of the same-looking cross. When you come to that, you don’t become color blind. That’s not biblical. Color-blindness doesn’t show off the beauty of God’s artistry. You don’t say, “Well, I don’t see black. I don’t see white. I don’t see nobody. I don’t even know what color you are right now. I’m color blind.” That’s not even in the Bible. That’s not anywhere near the Bible. God created everything distinctly and fearfully and wonderfully made. The more the beauty of the gospel transforms something and transforms your outlook on life, then the world God created being changed by Christ becomes beautiful. We deal with our issues. That’s my prayer tonight. That we don’t stop at racial reconciliation, but we take the umbrella and open it more widely. The umbrella of repentance…Because there can be no reconciliation without repentance. Reconciliation without repentance is phoniness, but reconciliation with repentance is beautiful gospel restoration. Father, we thank you and honor you for the ability to come to you in hope that sin is and will be dealt with. I thank you Jesus Christ dealt with our sin on the cross. I’m thankful for that. You have been so merciful to us. God, I just pray you would rock us with again the beauty of your holiness, taking care of sin through Christ. As our lives open up more progressively, Father, to Jesus Christ and his gospel and his death and his life and his resurrection, we have the glorious opportunity of not having to fear consequences anymore, because, ultimately, we will spend eternity with you and the eternal consequences of our sin are eradicated. Lord, help someone tonight who is hardened, who is still sitting there with their fists clenched at you. Will you grace them to be able to admit it, admit their deep need for you? In Jesus’ name, amen."
15,a-zeal-too-deep,0,"Good morning. It’s good to be here. I had a great time this weekend with your group leaders and with your pastors and staff, and getting ragged on by Josh Patterson. It was just a great, great time. It’s always great to be at The Village and to get to spend time in the Word with your church. This church has an insatiable appetite for the Scripture, and that’s a statement about your pastors. So it’s a privilege to get to be here today. I want to take a look at a passage the apostle John gives us here in the second chapter of his gospel, where Jesus cleanses the temple. Maybe you’ve read this passage before, and it may be familiar to you, but hopefully we can get some things out of this this morning. John, chapter 2, verse 13. It says, “The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there. And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables. And he told those who sold the pigeons, ’Take these things away; do not make my Father’s house a house of trade.’ His disciples remembered that it was written, ’Zeal for your house will consume me.’ So the Jews said to him, ’What sign do you show us for doing these things?’ Jesus answered them, ’Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.’ The Jews then said, ’It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?’ But he was speaking about the temple of his body. When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.” Here we have Jesus, who obviously grew up as a carpenter. He’s probably not just a soft guy. Right? He probably has some girth to him, I would imagine. He’s probably kind of tough and maybe has a build to him. He’s not just soft Jesus, tender Jesus, meek-and-mild Jesus. Indeed he is, but here we see Jesus in what I like to call his “Chuck Norris moment.” This is when he just cleans house, literally cleans house. Here’s the situation. Worshipers had come to Jerusalem for Passover, and they’re required during Passover to offer a sacrifice, but many of them had traveled a long way, and if you’ve ever tried to travel with an animal, you know that can be quite challenging. Like if you’ve ever tried to travel with a cat or something like that. I’m sure they weren’t bringing cats to sacrifice. I wouldn’t be opposed to that, but I’m sure that’s not what they were doing. If you’re a cat lover, I apologize. My family drove this summer from New York City all the way down to Dallas and brought our Goldendoodle puppy with us, so I know a little bit what it’s like to travel with an animal, and frankly, it’s a little challenging. So here you would have the opportunity to come and purchase an animal there in Jerusalem. They would also be required to pay a temple tax, but the currency you had to pay the tax with was a special currency. So you would take your currency and exchange it there at the temple for the temple currency, and then offer that payment as a temple tax. So what you had here were money traders and merchants who were selling animals and exchanging money, and in doing so were actually turning quite a profit. Jesus sees this going on and is obviously bothered by it. Now there was nothing wrong with selling the animals or changing the money. In fact, this was done, but it was typically done away from the temple confines, where it wouldn’t be a distraction at all, and it wasn’t to be done in a way to exploit the worshipers of God and to exploit this holiday. I mean, can you imagine anyone taking a religious holiday and exploiting it for profit? That’s what they do here, and it somewhat bothers Jesus. They’re exploiting the people with their own greed, and they’re capitalizing on a feast that was meant for the worship of God. Jesus said they’d made the house of God an emporium. They had made it like a shopping mall. So Jesus begins to weave together a whip. I can just see him over there putting together a whip, mumbling to himself, “They’ve made my Father’s house a house of trade.” Now listen. If you see someone making a weapon, mumbling under their breath, something is about to go down. That’s what happens here. Jesus makes this whip, and he begins to drive the animals and drive the merchants out of the temple, turning over tables, causing quite, what you call in Texas, a ruckus. The temple authorities are bothered by this. Though they should have been bothered more by the distraction that was going on in the temple and the injustice of some of these merchants, they were more bothered by Jesus. So they confront Jesus on this, and they ask him this question. They want to know, “What gives you the right to think that you have the authority to regulate what happens in the house of God? What gives you the authority to tell us what should happen in the temple?” They’re bothered by Jesus’ disruptive zeal, and they’re basically asking him, “Give us a sign to show us what right you have to exercise this kind of disruptive zeal in the house of God.” Jesus’ response is pretty mysterious. He says, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” They said, “Forty-six years it took to build this temple, and you’re going to raise it up in three days?” They misunderstood Jesus. He was actually saying, “Eventually, you people are going to kill me. You’re going to be so disrupted by my disruptive zeal that you’re actually going to kill me, and on the third day I’ll rise. By virtue of my death and resurrection,” Jesus is saying, “I have the authority to exercise this kind of zeal, and to command you about what you should be zealous about as well.” Now think about this. Jesus is saying by virtue of his life, death, and resurrection, he has the right to exercise this kind of zeal, but also he has the right to direct our zeal toward the place he deems appropriate. Jesus has the right to direct your zeal to the place he deems to be appropriate. This is what he’s upset about. He’s upset that people’s affections are being directed into a different way. Jesus is not only telling us how we are to live; he’s telling us what we’re to love. That is quite a bold move on his part. This is important, because every one of us in this room is zealous for something. Now we don’t use the word zeal a whole lot. It just means a burning passion, this burning passion, this deep love that sets your priorities. It fuels your actions. It determines your decisions. It could be a person, it could be money, it could be the approval of other people, it could be acclaim and respect, it could be possessions or comforts or some sort of pleasure, but it’s something you really do… If you had to be honest with yourself, you think about, you love this thing more than anything else. What you love most is what you live for, and all of us are zealous for something. There’s one thing that trumps all other zeals. There’s one passion you have that trumps all other passions, and when your passions in life, your interests in life, your desires in life conflict, there’s one desire, one passion, one zeal that has the tie-breaking vote. It dominates your life. It’s the highest authority in your life. In fact, it’s the engine of your life. It’s like the boiler room of your life. It moves you along and directs your life. It gets your time. It gets your attention. It gets your money. It consumes your resources. That word consume is found here in the text. It’s exactly what zeal does to us. Your zeal will consume you. It will consume your thoughts. It will consume your emotions. It will consume your decisions. It will consume your life. You will lose yourself to the object of your greatest zeal. You will lose yourself to your passion. So in this account, Jesus demonstrates for us that there’s only one proper place to set that kind of passion on. There’s only one proper place to put that kind of zeal towards. He’s showing us there is only one proper object of our zeal, one thing we should live for above all other things, one thing that should set our priorities, one thing that should fuel our actions, one thing that should drive our decisions. Jesus says, “That’s God.” You’re going, I knew he was going to say that. I think I’ve heard this sermon before. Jesus is telling us there’s one place only for you to set that kind of zeal and passion, and it’s upon God. There are two aspects of what we mean by being zealous for God. The first is that you would be zealous to know and love and honor God. That you want to know him and you want to love him and you want to trust him and you want to respond to him and you want to glorify him. You want to live your life in such a way that you’re living it in a right response to this God, where he’s the object of your greatest love. He’s the object of your greatest pursuit. A zeal to know, love, and honor God. Like Jeremiah says, “’Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me…’” Here’s what God wants for us: The one thing we would boast in, the one thing we’d say is, “This is what my life is given up for: I want to know God. I want to love God. I want to honor God. I want to live rightly related to God, open to God, responsive to God.” Zeal for God’s house consumed Jesus. In other words, he was most passionate about the glory of God, that God would be known, that God would be loved, that God would be treasured among his people. That’s what the temple is about. The temple was a place for people to meet God. It was a place for people to encounter God and to worship God and to adore God, to esteem God, to ascribe worth and value to him, to acknowledge his supremacy over everything. This is what the temple was about. It was to be a place of confession, a place of contrition, a place of brokenness, a place of praise, a place of sacrifice, a place of receiving the affirmation of God’s forgiveness and experiencing God’s mercy. That’s what the temple was about. A place of joy. It was to be a place to come and express the conviction, There is nothing more valuable, nothing more glorious in the entire universe than our great God, and there is nothing more important than me being rightly related to him and rightly responding to him with all of my life. That’s what the temple was about. But instead of experiencing that in this moment, the people are being distracted by all this commerce that’s taking place. Listen to how D.A. Carson describes this situation. He said, “Instead of solemn dignity and the murmur of prayer, there is a bellowing of cattle and the bleating of sheep. Instead of brokenness and contrition, holy adoration, and prolonged petition, there is noisy commerce.” They’re being distracted from this call to come and respond and interact and engage with God. The worship in this temple was not to be an event. It’s not as if they walked into the temple and just flipped the “God” switch and then turned it off on the way out. It was not like that. It was the expression of the essence of one’s life. This was a momentary expression of the very essence of your life. Not just an event, but an expression of your essence; that your whole life was to be marked by this great passion to know and love and honor God. But what they had done was turned this temple into an emporium, a shopping mall, a place not of praise and surrender to God but a place of personal gain. Here becomes the great conflict of our lives. Will I live for the glory and honor of God, to know him, love him, and trust him, or will I live merely for personal gain, for the increase of wealth, the increase of comforts, the increase of pleasures, the increase of my own self-focused joys? Will this be what I live for? Their zeal was not for God; their zeal was for profit. Jesus is not saying they had simply forgotten God, but they’d actually turned to another god, the god of commerce, the god of consumerism, the god of materialism, the god of self-focused, personal gain. Here the zeal was not centered on knowing and experiencing God, but on making a profit, padding their lives, increasing their own personal well-being. That, indeed, is what we find ourselves in…this constant conflict. Will I live for the glory of God? Will I be zealous to know him, love him, and honor him, or am I going to be zealous for my own comfort? Am I going to be one who worships the god of consumerism and materialism? I recently read there are 16.5 square feet of mall space for every American. That’s bigger than some New York City apartments. I’ve seen them. That much mall space for every American, because more than any other god, our nation bows at the feet of the god of materialism and consumerism, the god of personal gain, personal comfort, personal pleasures. Jesus is seeing this. These people don’t care about the glory of God; they care about their own personal gain. This kind of becomes a theme with the people of God surrounding the temple. Do you remember the prophet Haggai? Some of you are like, No, I don’t. Haggai doesn’t get a lot of airtime in the church. Maybe you were having your quiet time in Haggai this morning. I don’t know. Haggai was a prophet after the exile, where God is bringing the people back out of exile, bringing them into Babylon. They’d been conquered by the Babylonians, the temple was destroyed, Jerusalem ravaged, and they were sent out to Babylon in 586. Then 70 years later they come back to the land and there they begin to reconstruct the temple. They come back. They’ve gone through a season of discipline, and they come back now and they want to be faithful to God. They want to honor God, they want to worship God, and they want to be a community committed to God… So let’s rebuild the temple. Then they just stopped. They stopped, and Haggai is raised up to be the prophet to address the people. This is what it says in Haggai 1:3: “Then the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, ’Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?’” They quit working on the temple, and now they started building their own houses. And they weren’t just building a place for shelter. I mean, this is MTV Cribs. They are paneling their houses with the finest of woods. God says, “Let me get this straight. What’s more important to you is not the glory of your God, not the renown of your God, not the reputation of your God among all the nations, because for you to claim to have a God and have no temple, to let it lie in ruins, you’re dragging the reputation of God through the mud among the nations.” God says, “You’re okay with my temple in ruins, my name, my renown, while you’re building your own lives of personal comfort and gain?” This becomes the great conflict of our lives. What will we be more zealous for? The glory of our God, to know him, to love him, to see our God, to honor our God, to love our God, to respond to our God, to give God his appropriate place in our lives, or just simply pad our lives with comforts? The answer to that question is going to depend upon an evaluative decision, because when it comes to the object of your zeal, it’s an evaluative decision. The zeal you have for something is equal to the estimate of greatness and value you put on that something. So for you to have zeal about something, passion about something, is because you’ve put an estimated value upon that something. Your zeal will be an appropriate response to the value you placed upon that something. That’s why Paul can say, “I’ve suffered the loss of all things, and I count them to be dung compared to the surpassing value of knowing Jesus Christ, my Lord.” That’s an evaluative decision. That’s an estimate. That’s saying, “I have estimated the value of Jesus Christ to be supremely valuable, far above all things, so I’m willing to lose everything if I can just have him.” It comes down to an evaluative decision. Zeal for God is a response to the estimated greatness of God. Zeal for God is a response to the greatness of God. If we make a proper estimate, if we truly do a value analysis on this, what we see is there is nothing greater we could set our hearts upon. There’s nothing greater we could say, This is what I want to love, this is what I want to know, this is what I want to give my life fully for. It’s an evaluative decision to say, He is of infinite worth. He is of inestimable greatness. If we want to flourish as human beings… If I were to interview you and say, “Do you really want to flourish? Do you want to suck the marrow out of life? Do you really want your life to be full and rich?” I doubt many of you would go, “Eh, I just kind of want to get by.” I don’t think many of us would say that. I think we really want to have fullness of life, but if you’re going to experience fullness of life, you have to live in step with ultimate reality. You cannot construct an alternate reality for yourself and build your life upon that and think it’s going to go well for you. It will crush you in the end. It will fall apart. It will be ripped to shreds. If you build your life on an alternate reality, it will fail. You cannot take the direction that is opposite of the direction the universe is moving and expect that it’s going to go well for you. You have to live your life in step with ultimate reality. Have you ever seen this picture of a little kitten? Oh, here he goes ragging on cats again. The kitten is looking in a mirror and in the mirror is this giant lion. Have you seen this? Some of you are like, Yeah, I like that. Yeah, you probably have it hanging in your bathroom. A little kitten looking in the mirror, and the caption says, “What matters most is how you see yourself.” Now that’s not true. All that little kitten has to do is meet a ferocious dog in a back alley to learn, Oh, that isn’t true. Right? It doesn’t matter how that cat perceives itself necessarily. What matters is ultimate reality. It’s not a lion; it’s a kitten who just takes up space and serves no real purpose for humankind. (I’m teasing. I love kittens. They taste like chicken. Are we recording this?) It doesn’t matter how it perceives itself. If that little kitten perceives itself as a lion and does meet a ferocious dog in a back alley, its alternate reality will be ripped to shreds. It will fall apart. If you try to live your life and found it on and base it on and live in an arena of an alternate reality that you created, your life will not work. When it comes to zeal, it’s the same way. You have to make the right estimate. Here’s the right estimate: To say, “If I’m going to flourish in life and live in the light of ultimate reality, I must seek to glorify most what’s most glorious. I must love most what’s most lovely, and I must value supremely what’s supremely valuable. If I don’t, I’ve built an alternate reality that’s not in step with ultimate reality, and my life is just not going to work. It’s not going to work.” So the call here is that we would say, I want to respond to the greatness of God, and I want to set my life on the right things. If we could see the glory of God, the greatness of God, the supremacy of God, then I think what would happen is the unbearable lightness of the things we go after would be revealed to us. We would see just how trivial the things in our lives we give our hearts to really are. This is a great issue in our culture today. We live in what’s called a “superflat” culture. Mark Sayers’ book The Road Trip just came out. It’s a great read, interacting with Jack Kerouac’s book On the Road. Listen to what he says about a superflat culture that doesn’t really have a lot of depth to it and doesn’t have a sense of transcendence to it. Everything is just surface level. Here’s how he describes a superflat culture: “In a superflat culture where nothing matters, we escape into obsessions and hobbies, interests that bear little ultimate consequence. In a commodified culture, we move and shift around meaning, giving weight to things that do not deserve mountains of time and attention.” We give weight, significance, value, glory to things that do not deserve mountains of our time and attention. “The twenty-first century will be a century marked by conspicuous consumption but also a flagrant misuse of time. With religion off the agenda, our culture finds new avenues of devotion and distraction. Instead of moving us toward relationship and people, the immanent, superflat culture pushes us toward things.” Now listen. “Millions of hours in the twenty-first century will be spent working through DVD TV series, scanning social network sites, gorging on celebrity gossip, downloading music, flipping through home magazines, and playing computer games. Things will take precedence over people. Meaningless activities will overtake our lives. There is nothing wrong with interests and hobbies in their right place, but the twenty-first-century culture will gorge on such activities. The real issues of human existence that have sat front and center of human consciousness have in the superflat, immanent world been shoved aside. They are too heavy to be carried on the road. Instead we buzz across the surface of life, never venturing below the surface.” If you think about the things our culture is zealous for… Millions of hours in the twenty-first century spent watching TV, reading home magazines, hobbies, and interests…all those things okay; just put in the wrong place, consuming too much of our hearts. If we could just see the greatness of God, then we begin to see the triviality of all those other things. When we see their triviality, when we make a proper estimate on those things, then we put them in their right place. If we make a proper estimate on God, we put him in his right place. We don’t put him in his place; we see him in his place and respond to him. Let me say one more thing about this zeal for God. Zeal for God is awakened when we see his zeal for us. That’s also what the temple is about. The temple is really God’s statement that he wants to be with us. Have you ever thought about that? The temple was God’s way of saying, “I love you, and I would like to be with you.” If you trace the theme of temple throughout the Bible, it starts in the garden where the garden serves as God’s temple where he meets with his people. He walks with them and fellowships with them in the cool of the day. Then Adam and Eve sin. They rebel against God. They’re removed from God’s presence. But he promises that he’s going to restore all that was lost. He ends up choosing a man named Abraham, and from Abraham builds a nation, a nation among whom he can make his presence known. They find themselves in slavery, and God sends a deliverer, Moses, to rescue them, to say to Pharaoh, “Let my people go out of here and worship our God, meet with our God.” Eventually through a battle with Pharaoh, God miraculously delivers them from Egypt. They go into this journey to the Promised Land, and there God instructs them to build this tabernacle, and there in the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, he would meet with his people. He would manifest his presence among them. He would make himself known among his people. Then they settled in a nation, and they built a permanent structure, the temple. There as they dedicated the temple, the glory of God fell and filled the temple, and this would be the place where God would manifest his presence among his people, where he would meet with his people. We see this on and on, this idea of temple. It’s this place where God meets with man. It’s a place where God comes together with his people. It’s a place where God accepts his people because of a bloody sacrifice offered in their place there at the temple. Now Jesus teaches us in John 2 that the temple, that temple the people would come to and worship in, is being superseded by a greater temple…himself. That he is now the temple of God, that Jesus is God’s ultimate expression of his desire to be with you. Jesus is God’s ultimate expression of his desire to be with us. He is the place on earth where the presence of God is made manifest and dwells in its fullness. Colossians 1 tells us that in him all the fullness of Deity dwelt in bodily form. John 1:14: “The Word became flesh and tabernacled, dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory.” When Jesus was walking upon the earth, he was the very presence of God among us. He was the temple, and he is the place where we can meet with God and be accepted by God because of the bloody sacrifice he makes for us. This is what Jesus does. He comes and dies in our place that we might be reconciled to God. He is the temple, and he is the bloody sacrifice that’s made so we might be made right with God. Because of the work of Jesus, and through the work of Jesus, God has removed every obstacle standing in the way of you and me knowing him, enjoying him, being in right relationship with him, living our lives open in response to him, having him as our Father, knowing and loving our God. This is what Jesus is passionate about. Jesus was so passionate about you knowing, loving, enjoying, and being reconciled to God. He was consumed by this passion. He was so passionate about that, he was so zealous for you to know God, that it was the death of him. The zeal consumed him. The passion for you to know and love God was the very death of Jesus Christ, and nothing you could give your zeal to has ever given that much for you. Nothing you could ever set your heart’s love on has ever given that much for you. When you see the grace of God, when you see his zeal for you, his passion, your heart is warmed towards him. This is why your devotional life is critical. We do not read the Bible to avoid the guilt of reading the Bible. We read the Scripture because we want to encounter our God. We want to see him in his greatness, and we want to experience and taste his grace as he reveals it to us by his Spirit off the pages of the Word and works gospel enjoyment into our hearts. Your devotional life is key if you’re going to estimate the greatness of God and fully enjoy the grace of God. When that begins to happen, God starts to arrest your zeal. He starts to take your zeal and place it where it needs to be placed. So it is a zeal for us to know and love and interact with and respond to our God and glorify and honor our God, but here’s the second element of zeal for God: It’s that you would have zeal for others to come and know and love God, that you would want others to taste and see that the Lord is good. This is what you would be passionate about and zealous for. This temple episode here is actually happening in a portion of the temple called the “court of the Gentiles.” The court of the Gentiles was the only place in the temple where those who were not Jews could actually enter into the temple and worship God. So for these people to conduct their commerce there was to actually hinder those Gentiles from coming in and experiencing God in the temple. In the other gospel accounts, Jesus speaks against these merchants and traders like this: “My Father’s house is to be a house of prayer for all the nations.” Do you see what’s going on here? Jesus is passionate about the nations. He’s passionate about all people coming to know and experience God. In fact, this has always been God’s design for the temple. God’s design for the temple has not just been a place for his people to meet. It has not just been a place for worship; it was intended to be a place of witness. When Solomon builds this temple and consecrates it, listen to the prayer he prays in 1 Kings, chapter 8. Solomon is lifting up his voice in prayer to God and he says, “Likewise, when a foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, comes from a far country for your name’s sake (for they shall hear of your great name and your mighty hand, and of your outstretched arm), when he comes and prays toward this house, hear in heaven your dwelling place and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to you, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house that I have built is called by your name.” Solomon says, “God, as we consecrate this temple, we pray that you would do such powerful work among your people, that for the sake of your great name, your mighty hand, your outstretched arm would be upon us, and you would work wonders in our midst so that the surrounding nations would know there is a God and he dwells among the people of Israel, and we want to know that God. We want to experience that God. And that all the ends of the earth would fear him.” This has always been God’s heart for his people, and it’s still God’s design for his people. If you trace the theme of temple in the Scriptures from the crucifixion, the resurrection, the ascension of Jesus, and the outpouring of his Holy Spirit upon his people, we see that the church, the people of God have now become the temple of God. We are the place, the people among whom God manifests his presence. We are the people among whom God is making himself known. Listen to what it says in 1 Corinthians, chapter 3, verse 16. “Do you not know that you are God’s temple [you being in the plural] and that God’s Spirit dwells in you? If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.” Ephesians 2: “In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.” We the church, the people of God, are now the place where God desires to manifest his presence, where his outstretched arm, his mighty hand would be upon the people of God, that we would see the Spirit of God at work so powerfully in our midst that others outside of the people of God would take notice. They would say, “There is a God in our city, and he dwells among the people of The Village Church. Look at what’s happening in there.” When you look at the Scriptures and speak of the fruit of the Spirit, the qualitative distinctiveness of your relationships with one another, the love that exists between you, the joy that exists in this community, the peace that exists in this community, when you look at the love of God being manifested through forgiveness and reconciliation of marriages, when you look at the wonderful works God is performing right here in your midst, people all around are saying, “There’s a God in our city, and he’s at work among those people.” The supernatural power of God working among the people of God so that those who are far from God would come to know God. This has always been God’s desire for his people, and this is what Jesus is zealous for. The people of God are the greatest apologetic for the gospel of God. I talked about this this weekend at the Group Leader Conference, but do you know how there are some restaurants you go to because there’s that one thing on the menu you can’t get anywhere else? You sit down, and you’re not going to get a Big Mac anywhere else. You can only get it one place. Right? I know that’s a poor example. You’re the cultural elites. You don’t go there, right? There are some restaurants… I come here because I get this every time. There’s nowhere else I can get this. There ought to be people who say this about the people of God. “When I go there, when I’m among those people, when I’m at a table with those people, when I’m in a party with those people, when I’m in the presence of those people, I experience something among them I can’t experience anywhere else. There is such forgiveness, there is such mercy, there is such joy, there is such generosity, there is such reconciliation, there is such covenant commitment in marriages… I don’t see it anywhere else. If there is a God, he’s among them.” This is what Paul said in the Corinthian letters when he’s talking about the Spirit of God being so active among the people of God that some outsider would walk in and say, “Truly God is in your midst,” and he would fall on his face and he would worship God. It’s the supernatural power of God working among the people of God so that those who are far from God would come to know God. It has always been God’s desire that we live such lives of compelling devotion, marked by the supernatural power of God, manifest through the fruit of the Spirit and the gifts of the Spirit, that people are provoked to consider the God who’s present among you. It has always been God’s desire. Let me ask you this: Are you zealous for others to come to know God, and is there anything in your life compelling enough to provoke people in that direction? You can’t manufacture that. There is a difference between manufacturing the Christian life and manifesting the life of Christ. Those are two totally different things. The Spirit of God wants to do such a powerful work among you that the very life of Christ, his fruit and his power, is made manifest among you as a people. Are you zealous for your neighbors? Do you know your neighbors’ names? Are you zealous for your neighbors to come to know God? Is that zeal fueling your actions? Is it determining your priorities? Is it directing your decisions? Does it affect your money? Do you have a desire to see the nations, your neighbors and the nations, come to know this great God, and is there anything compelling about your life and your community that would provoke others to want to know this God who’s present in your midst? Let me say this last thing about zeal. Zeal will consume you. It says here, “Zeal for your house will consume me.” Zeal for anything does that. If there is anything in your life…whether it’s a person, whether it’s a job, whether it’s money or personal comforts, whatever…your zeal will consume you. It will consume your thoughts, consume your emotions, consume your money, and consume your decisions. It will control you, and it will eventually be the death of you, a downward spiral away from the person you were created to be, a downward spiral into slavery to the object of your zeal. Whether you’re a slave to your money, or a slave to your toys, or whether you’re a slave to comfort, whether you’re a slave to convenience, or whatever, zeal will be the death of you. I want to say this. Zeal for God will consume you, and it will also be the death of you. Zeal for God will be the death of you. You will die to yourself, you will die to the worship of self, you will die to the pursuit of selfish interest, you will die to your own reputation, and you will die to selfish indifference. It will be a death to you. Zeal for God will kill you, but it’s the only death that involves a resurrection. Did you notice that in the passage? Zeal for the Father consumed Jesus and was the death of him, but it’s the only death that involves a resurrection. As we die, we find that we’re truly starting to live. As we die, we’re becoming more and more of what we’re made to be: lovers of God and lovers of other people. This is the great commandment, that you would love God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself. It’s God’s dream for us. One day we’re going to realize that was indeed worth it. We’re going to realize there was no greater way we could have lived, because if you keep following the theme of temple in the Scriptures, and you trace it all the way to the very last chapter of the book, it brings you to Revelation 21:22. Listen to what this says in the last book of the Bible. “And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.” When it all comes down to it, we’re going to finally fully dwell with our God, and he will dwell with us, and he himself will be the temple. We’ll see him, and when we see him we’ll know it was worth it. Let me just close by giving you this challenge: When you think about what’s ahead of you…seeing him…live the way you’re going to one day wish you had lived. Live the life you’re going to one day wish you had lived: zealous for God, responding to his greatness, responding to his grace, and then zealous to see others come and know him, as you the people of God experience the power of God at work in you so that those outside of you might come to know your God. Let me pray for you to that end. Father, thank you that you sent your Son from your side to be a sacrifice for us that we might be reconciled to you and become your people. Thank you that you’ve poured your Holy Spirit out upon your people, and thank you that your Holy Spirit is at work to bring about distinctiveness in our lives, the fruit of your Holy Spirit, to empower us with his gifts that we might be a provocative people who pull others into, who draw others, into a knowledge of you. God, would you bless the people of The Village Church? Would you let your grace be upon them? Would you continue to raise them up as a people of witness, as a people of worship? Would you make them a people who have great impact, not only in their cities, but also in the nations? God, would you bless them, cause your face to shine upon them, give them your peace? God, for those who are sitting here and they’ve been building their life on an alternate reality, would you reveal to them there’s nothing greater they could live for than our triune God? Call them to yourself. We pray in Jesus’ name, amen."
16,under-the-faucet,0,"If you have your Bibles, grab them. Psalms, chapter 27. If you just started coming to The Village Church in the last couple of weeks, my name is Matt Chandler, and I’m the pastor here. It’s good to be back. I’ve been gone for a while. We have a ton to do, so I’m just going to get going. Late in high school, I had a teacher who turned me on to the Civil Rights Movement. I always was kind of a fan of history. He kind of turned me on to the Civil Rights Movement. That really grew in college. I was a Leadership minor, and really the things that got accomplished in that 15-year window and continue to be accomplished because of that 15- or 20-year window is remarkable. As I began to study the Civil Rights Movement, there was a singular letter that Martin Luther King Jr. wrote in April of 1963. It’s a very well-known letter (if you follow history and if you’re familiar with this movement) called “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” That letter haunted me, and I’ll explain why it haunted me after I read you a portion of the letter. Just to set the framework for where this letter was written, Martin Luther King Jr. had come into Birmingham, and they had staged a series of sit-ins, marches, and sanctions against the economy of Birmingham for the oppression of African Americans in Birmingham and was imprisoned in that process. The local white clergymen had accused King of lacking patience and that he should trust them to push this ball of civil rights forward. If you haven’t read this, you need to Google it. You’ll find it easily. At the beginning of the letter, he said he usually does not respond to critics because if he responded to all his critics, he would do nothing other than respond to his critics. He said but in this case since they were brothers, he was going to respond to him. So this is a part of that letter. “Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, ’Wait.’ But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at a whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick, and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your 20 million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your 6-year-old daughter why she can’t go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a 5-year-old son who is asking, ’Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?’; when you take a cross-country drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day and day out by nagging signs reading ’white’ and ’colored’; when your first name becomes ’Nigger,’ your middle name becomes ’boy’ (however old you are) and your last name becomes ’John’; and your wife and mother are never given the respected title ’Mrs.’; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of ’nobodiness,’ then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience. You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court’s decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools…” So this letter was written in 1963. Schools are still segregated. In 1954, the Supreme Court deemed it was illegal to segregate schools. So King’s point is, “Yeah, we’re breaking some laws while we press that certain laws take place.” He sees that’s paradoxical, so he is trying to explain it here. “…at first glance, it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break some laws.” One may well ask, ’How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?’ The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that ’an unjust law is no law at all.’“ Now let me tell you why this haunted me. First of all, this is not the distant past. Are you tracking with that? This is not 200 years ago. This is ’63. A lot of people in these services were alive in ’63, and not ”alive“ like a baby in Mama’s arms alive. Here’s what haunts me about the reality of the African American in 1963. I thought this. I knew I was coming out of this. I was ready to preach this message, and earlier this week, my 3-year-old daughter, Norah, pulled out this bench that sits at the end of our bed. She set it in the middle of our bedroom, and she climbed up on it. Now there was some music going in the background while Lauren and I were getting dressed. She was still in her pjs. She pretended she was on the balance beam from the Olympics. She twisted around and twirled. I was giving her commentary. ”Norah Chandler from the United States of America. Oh, look at this, ladies and gentlemen. Here comes the twist and the dismount. She stuck it!“ Lauren and I applauded, and we scored her right. She got about a 6.2 or something like that. We scored it, and we all celebrated it. All three of my children are a delight to me, so I just want to speak very frankly and honestly. You turn a dog loose on any of my children, I will physically murder you. Do you understand what I’m saying? I mean, you can laugh all you want, but I would punch you and choke you and try to rip out your… I would physically try to destroy you. You might be a big ol’ boy. I’ll take my chances. I’m wiry, but I know the soft spots. You might be all yoked up, MMA fighter. I’ll punch you in the throat. I don’t care how bad you are. You’re going to go to the ground, and I’m going to take the boots to you. Here’s my thought. Here’s what was haunting to me. How did they do this week in, week out, month in, month out, century in, century out with nothing on the horizon? The Supreme Court of the United States of America said in 1954, ”This stops.“ Nearly a decade later, nothing had changed. How did they do it? How did, week in and week out, they walk under this oppression without going violent? The thing to keep in mind is if you watch the Civil Rights Movement under King, it doesn’t go violent. Now things get goofy after King, but if you watch King and you watch King as he leads, it never goes violent. So I’ve always wondered, How did they do it? Now I know the big answer: God. I know the big answer, but I want to know how they did it because there has to be some special dispensation of grace, because I’m telling you…what I said earlier is the honest truth. I know I’d go to jail. I know I’d make the news. I know I’m going to lose my job. There’s not going to be like, ”Well, he was just in murdering the guy. Let’s let him preach.“ That’s not going to happen. I know all it would cost me. I know my other children would not get to visit Daddy except through glass, and I would still murder you. How did they do it? About four or five months ago, we had Dr. Rick Rigsby come speak to our staff. Dr. Rick Rigsby was a long-time professor at Texas A&M University. In the end, I cornered Dr. Rigsby, because I needed to know the answer to this question because it really has haunted me all these years. I’ve never been able to figure out how they endured. He said, ”There were multiple pieces, but let me give you the main one.“ What he pointed to as the main refuge, that thing that sustained the obedience of African Americans in the 60s during the Civil Rights Movement was how they approached God and how they worshiped with one another. I don’t know if you’ve been a part of an African American church service. The way they do it is call and response. Do you understand what that means? That means in that service, there are no spectators but God, and everybody has come to play. There is interaction at every level of worship. It’s not guys on stage and people in the crowd. It’s we’re all here to get after the Lord. It’s going to go long, and it’s going to go good. Man, I don’t know if you’ve been there, but in June, I was invited to speak at the E.K. Bailey Expository Preaching Conference. It was me and a thousand African American pastors. Only white dude in the room. I started preaching and they started… It threw me off. I mean, everybody was shouting out. It threw me off because I’m used to you. Here’s what you do. I’m like, ”What’s that word? What does that say?“ You mumble. Right? I had a guy pacing in the back going, ”That’s right. Come on!“ Anglos don’t do that. Anglos have had bred into them, have been trained, ”You are here to perform for me. I am not a participant in this. I am a spectator,“ because we have not borne the crushing weight of desperate need. So tell me about that, Pastor. Not a ”joining in with“ but rather… So Rigsby said they would come in. That’s where the four-hour service is. If you get white people talking about black church, and you’re like, ”I’m going to check out this church.“ They’re like, ”Pack a lunch, bro. Pack your lunch! I’m just sayin’! They’re going to sing for like two hours. They’re going to preach for an hour-and-forty-five minutes. They’re going to sing for two hours. You better bring a sandwich or a cracker or something, man. You’re going to die.“ That’s not how Anglos do it, is it? Most Anglos are like, Hey, listen. You better be starting to wrap it up now, Pastor Chandler. Right? So this call and response culture was they pressed hard into the presence of God. Here’s what’s spectacular, if you think about it. In that four-hour gathering, nothing got solved. So they’re walking into that service past signs that read, ”Colored,“ ”Whites only,“ past restaurants they are not allowed to go into, out of impoverished neighborhoods with impoverished schools into a worship center. In that four hours…listen to me…nothing changed. They walked right out, and those signs were still there, right back to their impoverished housing, right back to the broken system. Nothing changed, but in those four hours, they met with the living God, and upon meeting with the living God, he was enough to sustain them and to make all of that go away for just a bit. What happened as Rigsby began to unpack that this was the fuel for their obedience, some other Scriptures started to jump out to me. Let’s go to Psalms 27. We’re going to pick it up in verse 4. King David has nothing in common with an African American in the 60s. Nothing. Hence the title King David. I want you to watch what King David prays to God. Psalms 27. We’re going to pick it up in verse 4. ”One thing have I asked of the Lord, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple.“ Now let’s stop. We’re going to read more of this, but I want to stop. I, at times, can feel stressed. Now I feel as though I have very busy, albeit good, life. I pastor this church. I’m president of the Acts 29 church planting network, 450 churches on six continents (and growing), writing books, teaching outside of here. I’m a very busy man. I can get stressed out. Anybody else can feel a bit overwhelmed and stressed out? Yeah, okay. But you and I aren’t kings. You and I might be businessmen and salesmen, and we might have busy lives, but no one is managing a kingdom. If it is, it’s your tiny, little, sad kingdom. You feel like you have a kingdom, you have a little ghetto kingdom, all right? You’re not sovereign of your own state. You can’t declare people get murdered. You can’t declare people can be executed. You can’t declare this is the tax rate, can you? If you can, please call me. You can’t do those things. King David can, and he has the Philistines that are a nation on the border of Israel that can’t seem to learn to quit invading. You say, How many times does he have to conquer the Philistines in one reign? He beats them, and they run off. They come back. He beats them. They run off and come back. He beats them. They run off and come back. I mean, just destroying the Philistines over and over and over again. They just regroup and come back for more. He has the Philistines. He has massive family issues. King David’s family belonged on The Jerry Springer Show. His son rapes his daughter, leads a rebellion against him that disposes him from his throne for a good period of time. That’s family drama. It beats whatever family drama you came in here with today. You may be like, We don’t get along well. Okay. Unless your child has kicked you out of your own house, you’re doing all right. You’re doing all right. So David has massively complex issues both as a statesman and as a husband and father, but did you hear his prayer? Do you see that those problems are on his radar, but he is not asking for the solution to any of those problems? He is saying, ”One thing have I asked…that will I seek after.“ ”What I need, I need to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord and to seek him in his temple.“ Now let’s chat, because we have to understand the presence of God. When David says he wants to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of his life, he is not saying, I really like just to hang out in church. You know what I’ll do? Let’s escape. Let’s forget crazy family. Let’s forget the stresses of work. Let’s just 24/7 church-service it. That’s not what he is saying. The Bible is clear the glory of God and the presence of God cannot be held by the temple. It can’t. Even at the erection of the temple, the Bible is clear that the glory of God is way too big for the temple and that it overflows out of the temple. So God is present in two different ways. God is present in his omnipresence. What that means is God is everywhere, always in his fullness. Do you understand all those components? He is everywhere, always in his fullness. So right now, God is here just like he is on Pluto, just like he is in the farthest reaches of the universe. There’s not like a little piece of him here and a little piece of him there. He is always everywhere in his fullness. That’s called omnipresence. There’s a second kind of presence the Bible often speaks of, and that’s what theologians would call special presence or manifest presence. That’s when God reveals his presence in such a way that his glory is made visible. It is felt in our hearts. Upon his arrival, what is truly important is visible, and what is not important no longer seems important. Are you tracking with that? So God shows up. He shows up in a spectacular, visible way. He moves hearts. Our hearts are softened. Maybe tears come. Maybe we fall to our knees. We feel small. He seems big, and that brings about joy. That’s manifest presence. That’s special presence. When David says, ”What I’m after is to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,“ he is not talking about omnipresence. He is talking about special presence. When he says, ”That I may gaze upon your beauty,“ he is talking about seeing and savoring God in such a way that he becomes supreme in David’s affections. He is talking about manifest presence, not omnipresence, because when we experience manifest presence, look at what David says happens. This is verse 5. ”For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble.“ Okay, I love that the Bible never pretends the day of trouble isn’t coming. Did you notice he didn’t say, ”You don’t need a shelter because he’ll stop the storm“? No, he doesn’t say that. A storm is coming. He is going to protect you in the storm. You shouldn’t be surprised when storms come. The Bible never says they’re not coming. In fact, the Bible almost goes over the top going, ”They’re coming! They’re coming!“ What God has promised us is not that he would save us from the storm but that he would protect us in the storm. Then look at this next line. ”He will conceal me under the cover of his tent.“ The tent in the Old Testament almost always is referring to the Tent of Meeting. That’s how they would hear somebody talking about a tent, specifically in relationship to God. So the Tent of Meeting is where God would meet with Moses. When God was in the tent, it’s not an omnipresence, because he is always in the tent. An omnipresence. But when God’s presence would fall on the Tent of Meeting, Moses would go in there. Smoke would cover the tent, just as a way of going, ”Hey, man. You’re not ready for this. Don’t come in or you’ll get killed. Don’t come into this tent right now. I’m talking with my boy Moses. Stay away.“ His special presence would fall. The Tent of Meeting is the idea of a heavy, thick manifest presence of God. The promise is in the day of storm, we will not only be protected, but God will draw us into his tent, which is why the manifest presence of God is such a spectacular thing. As a church, one of the things we see a lot of is the dark night of the soul for people. There was a woman in our last service whose husband died just a couple of months ago. Last night, there was a woman and man who lost their 6-year-old son to neuroblastoma just a couple of years ago. I could go on and on and on and on. There is a tremendous amount of loss and grief among our people because we live in a fallen world. One of the things I’ve been able to pick out over my nearly decade with you now is that in that room, God shows up in such a way that he grants peace that passes understanding. It’s not that everything is okay. If you think back to that opening illustration of the Civil Rights, it’s not that everything is okay. It’s just that in that moment, God is so near that all of that melts away and you get what you need. You have him. Then he says next, if you’ll look at that next line, not only will he pull us into his tent, but he will lift us high upon a rock. The psalmist, in particular David, loves to talk about his feet being set upon rock. Three years ago, I was still… I can’t believe we’re almost three years out. Lauren and I sat across the table with my neurosurgeon, and he said, ”Best-case scenario here is probably two to three years. You have two to three years, so you need to start to figure out how to head on home to be with the Lord. Here’s your timeline: probably two to three years on average. That’s your bell curve.“ That afternoon in his office, man, the bottom just dropped out from underneath both Lauren and me. Man, I couldn’t, for all I tried to muster, even talk. We just cried a lot and hugged a lot. I was having to dial my phone and give it to Brian Miller, chairman of the elders here, who is now one of our lead pastors, and he was talking to my friends and telling other loved ones, ”This is what they’ve just been told,“ because I simply didn’t have it in me. We were already getting pinged a lot by people asking what we had heard, so we were rolling out information through him. I just couldn’t get my bearings. I mean, everything and nothing simultaneously was going through my head. How do I prepare my kids for this? You don’t die pretty of brain cancer. How do I prepare them for what they’re about to see? How do I lead well and finish well with the church? Am I ever going to feel strong again ever? Am I ever going to have energy again? Am I about to get pounded the last two years of my life with poison and radiation? Is this how this ends for me? All this and nothing is flying through my head simultaneously, and I couldn’t get my footing. I felt like I was sinking in sand. Then later that night, the tears ran out. I don’t know if you’ve had that experience yet where there are no more tears to come out of you. You need a Gatorade or something. I mean, you’re done. In the middle of that dark night of the soul, we began to remember some things. Some texts began to be stirred up in my heart. God began to pull me into the Tent of Meeting, began to shelter me from the storm, began to shelter Lauren from the storm. Then we began to remember, He is not God; God is God. He’s guessing; he knows. He’s doing mathematics, and he created numbers. He’s prophesying in part; he knows in full. Although God has chosen not to stop this, and he could have, that means he is at work in ways I don’t understand, and I need to simply trust him. We began to grow in confidence. It’s not in my doctors, although I love my doctors. Not in confidence in my ability to fight cancer. You don’t fight cancer. Cancer will kick the crap out of you. You can talk all day. It will light you up. Anybody who has gone through it, you simply survive a day at a time. All that bravado, ”Live strong!“ Live strong while you’re throwing up on your bathroom floor? I don’t think so. You put that swoosh on you all you want. It will kick the trash out of you. I didn’t have confidence in me, in my will. I just thought there was a God who was able, and I was trusting him to be willing. A day at a time I believed he was going to give me all the strength I needed for that day. I believe he loves my kids more than I do. He loves my wife more than I love my wife. He can be trusted. ”I’m yours. Wring me out how you want, but I believe you’re able and you’re willing to heal me completely. I’m going to walk in that until you reveal something else.“ I began to get my feet back on the rock. That’s what happens in manifest presence, special presence. God makes himself known in a real and tangible way. He brings about peace. He shelters, and then he gets your feet out of the muck and the mire, and he gets it up on the rock. It doesn’t make the problems go away. It doesn’t mean the difficulty goes away. It means he is enough, even in the difficulties. Then look where he goes next. ”And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me…“ So my head will be lifted up. If you are defeated, the posture of defeat is head down, but what he is saying is, ”Get your heads up.“ The psalmist does this line: ”Get your eyes up. Lift up your heads. Get your heads up.“ Why? ”Because he and his presence have vanquished, have conquered, your enemies.“ Now I need you to hear this. No matter who you are, you only have two enemies. There are only two. I know some of you are like, Well, you don’t know my life. You don’t know Stacey. I would say that, and I know there is some poor woman in here named Stacey. She is like, Really? You have two enemies. Are you ready? Here they are. Here are your two enemies: Satan and demonic forces and you. That’s it. Those are the only enemies you have. Even Stacey (sorry, if you’re Stacey) fits into one of those two categories: your enemies are either demonic in nature or flesh-oriented. They are your iniquities, your bents, your sinfulness. I preach my guts out to you that no one has lied to you, betrayed you, and deceived you more than you have. No one. No one! You are your greatest enemy. Now here’s why we get our heads up: because when the manifest presence of God shows up, when that special presence shows up, both of those completely lose their power. If you’ll remember King Saul was tormented by demons, and then David would play his harp. I know that doesn’t sound manly, but keep in mind he killed Goliath and bears and lions, which is a lot manlier than however manly you are. So get off of him about his harp! He is playing his harp, and when he played his harp, the manifest presence of God would come down, and the demons would flee from Saul, and Saul would feel comfort. When the manifest presence of God falls, the demonic realm and the powers of dark spiritual forces lose the loudness of their voice. When the manifest presence of God shows up you feel small; God feels big. There’s a great deal of joy in that smallness. When God’s spirit and God’s presence really reveal themselves, you don’t think you’re awesome at all, but you know who is, and that’s a delight! That’s why he is going, ”Get your head up! Get your head up! Desire this. Want this. Seek this. Get your head up! Your enemies will be triumphed.“ Then look at the net result. ”…and I will offer in his tent [in that presence] sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to the Lord.“ So the only right, good response to the manifest presence of God is fervent, passionate worship of his name and his renown. We’ll talk more about that momentarily. Now I want to make this a bit pragmatic. I don’t want it to be ethereal. I don’t want you to be like, Oh, okay. Manifest presence, and not really know. I want to make it a bit pragmatic. I want us to talk about how we seek it and what it is, because what David just said is, ”What I want, what I’m after, what I’m seeking, this one thing I need… I don’t need the kingdom to be at peace. I don’t need things at home to be made right. What I need is his presence. If I can get into that manifest presence, all of that will be okay. I’ll be satisfied. I’ll be empowered to keep walking with joy despite my circumstances. This is the thing I seek and I’m after.“ What we find in David’s life is when he can’t get there he gets really frustrated. ”As the deer pants for the water, so my soul longs for you, O God.“ ”I thirst for you. I’m hungry. When I can meet with God?“ That’s that angst of wanting to get into the manifest presence and not being able to get there. In fact, the Bible says us to seek this presence. Psalms 105, verse 4, says, ”Seek the Lord and his strength; seek his presence continually!“ So you and I are to seek after the manifest presence of God. Now I need to be really straight with you. You and I cannot control the manifest presence of God. You cannot make God show up in special ways. You can’t make him! You don’t have that key. It’s not a combination lock. It’s not if you go to the right twice past zero and come to seven and then back to the left to seven and then all the way back around to seven to form the perfect number 777, the Spirit of God will fall, manifest presence will be there, and energy and life and strength, vitality, and refreshment will return to life. No, not at all. Although we cannot control the manifest presence of God, what we learn from Scripture is that there are things that attract the manifest presence of God, and there are things that repel the manifest presence of God. What I want to do now with my sermon… That was all intro. Don’t panic. Don’t panic. You’re going to be okay. What I want to do now is I want to go very quickly into what the things are that attract this manifest presence and what the things are that repel this manifest presence. Okay? What are the things God delights in and longs to come into, and what are the things that repel him? Think about it this way. Last night it rained. I don’t know if you saw that. It was pretty crazy. I didn’t even know what it was. It kind of scared me at first. The only way to get wet was to be outside, right? The only way to get wet was to be outside. We had a bunch of people in our services on Saturday night. Here’s the thing. None of them got wet. We heard the thunder. Nobody got wet in this building, but do you know when we did get wet? When we went outside. What I’m about to talk about doesn’t guarantee rain, but it puts you in the place where rain can occur so when rain occurs, you get wet. So think what we’re about to talk about is getting ourselves under the faucet. It doesn’t turn the faucet on. It just puts us under it so if God, in his mercy, would turn it on, we’ll get drenched. What attracts the manifest presence of God? Two big buckets. 1. Personal holiness. Let me give you a couple of texts. Psalms 41, verse 12. ”But you have upheld me because of my integrity, and set me in your presence forever.“ Let me give you one more. Psalms 51, verses 10 through 12. ”Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.“ Now if you’re thinking through the grid of omnipresence/special presence, how can God cast you from his presence if he is everywhere? This has to be talking about special presence, manifest presence. ”Create in me a clean heart, O God…“ ”Because of my integrity, you have set me in your presence.“ We talk a lot here about treasuring Jesus, loving Jesus. Having Jesus is what we’re most after, what we most desire, what we most love. How that translates into obedience is, I want to be obedient to all God has asked me to be obedient to so I might experience the fullness of his presence and his power. It’s like, the manifest presence of God is better than this. I’m not going to trade these two. It’s an awful trade. Pornography, lust, adultery, cheating, stealing, these things are not better than the manifest presence of God. I want the manifest presence of God, so I want to line myself up with how God created me to operate for the fullness of my joy and to get myself underneath the faucet. This means we are people who confess and repent often. Let me show you this at play. Acts 3:19 through 21. You have a pretty legit sermon here. Let me read to you this. It’s going to be on the screen. ”Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out…“ That’s great news. ”…that times of refreshing may come…“ Now I don’t meet too many people who are like, Yeah, I don’t need to be refreshed. You know what I don’t want right now? Refreshment. I don’t want more vitality, more life. I just don’t need it. I just don’t need it! He says repent, and if you’ll repent, if you’ll turn, your sins will be blotted out, and times of refreshing might occur. Watch this. ”…that times of refreshing may come from…“ What? Are you serious? I did a 25-minute intro on call and response, and I got a silent room on that? So times of refreshing occur from the presence of what? The Lord. That’s not omnipresence; that’s special presence. How are we refreshed? By the manifest presence of God, not merely by instruction but by presence, which leads me to number two. This one is going to be uncomfortable. Now follow me here. I know this is going to wig some of you out. God’s manifest presence is also attracted to… 2. Fervent, passionate worship in song. Look at me. God loves when we sing to him. He loves it! He says he inhabits the praises of his people! Can you believe it? He inhabits it. As we sing to him, as we make much of him, as we fervently sing and shout and clap and love God and sing what is true about God, he inhabits that praise. In fact, he commands us to do it. So Psalms 95:1-2. ”Oh come, let us sing to the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation! Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise!“ Psalms 100, verse 2. ”Serve the Lord with gladness! Come into his presence with…“ What? Oh now we’re having church. ”Come into his presence with singing!“ Now let me point out a couple of things to you, all right? First thing, I’m not just talking about singing. We don’t sing to God via roteness. This is the part where we sing. Most of us treat singing unto the Lord as an add-on to instruction. Now there is a strong place among the people of God for instruction, but I want you to hear this and understand it. There will be a day where instruction ceases. Do you get that? When we’re in glory, God is not going to ask me to exposit the Scriptures. We’re not going to all be there and Jesus go, ”Chandler, explain to them.“ ”Okay, 1 Timothy. When the Holy Spirit told Paul to write to Timothy to the church at Ephesus, here’s what he meant.“ There’s not going to be any instruction, but there will be passionate, zealous worship through song. God loves it. Before C. S. Lewis’ conversion, he said he was reading the Psalms, and God sounded like a little old lady asking for compliments. He said after his conversion, he understood what he needed most was actually to give God compliments and that his soul was never more alive than when he was ascribing to God God’s worth. I know some of us are old school and are like, Well I just don’t like the repetition. Then you are going to hate heaven, right? I mean, you’re like, I don’t like to sing the same thing over and over and over again. Then eternity is going to be awful for you, because right now and since the beginning of everything, there have been living creatures around the throne of God saying, ”Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty“ on replay! That’s never switching to a new song. Now let me tell you why repetition is so profound: because it digs down in your gut. Do you understand what I’m saying by that? It gets it past your shoulders. It’s not just brain worship, ”That’s true. That’s true. That’s true.“ Great, but I want my heart involved in that truth. I want my gut involved in that truth. I want to be moved by that truth. If you have to preach the gospel over and over and over again to get it, then why don’t we believe we might need to sing some things over and over and over again to get it? Listen, I know all the emails I’ll get this week outside of the murder ones. I already know that’s coming. I can’t believe… I’ve already coached my admin, ”Just say you know what I was trying to say and ship it back.“ I’m not answering a bunch of murder emails this week. When all is said and done, I know the arguments I am going to get. ”That’s emotional manipulation. You’re trying to invoke the emotions.“ Okay, a couple of things. I’m not trying to manipulate anything, and I am absolutely trying to invoke the emotions. Absolutely I am! When did the Devil throw in the emotions in the creative narrative? I’ve read the Word of God. I know God created you, and I know God made you in his image and gave you emotions. That wasn’t the Devil. The Devil didn’t swoop in and go, ”I’m going to give them happiness and gladness and joy.“ God wove that into you, and God wants those emotions to be stirred up by what is true and to terminate upon him. Now if your emotions are being invoked by what is not true, then that’s manipulation. I have a problem with that. To try to stir up your hearts in gladness toward Jesus Christ by maybe repetition, there’s nothing sinful or wrong about that. That’s not Wesleyan Revivalism. That’s not what that is. The guilt seat would be Wesleyan revival where you would sit your lost friends in a certain seat, and I would know about it, and I’d talk to them during the service. That’s emotional manipulation, not truth that stirs us up to sing unto the Lord. Now here’s the second thing we have to talk about when we talk about ascribing value and singing fervently to the Lord. Fervency is different for all of us. Can we agree? Some of us redline differently than others. My wife and I laugh about this. Some of the elders and I laugh about this. You never want me at 100 percent. I always need to be a little tired. Matt Chandler at 80 percent is tolerable. You can already see what’s happening with just a couple of weeks off. I need to always be just a little bit tired because if I’m redlining, then bad things happen. I’m like, ”We’re going to plant 9,000 churches this year. Let’s go! All right, let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go! All right. Gather the troops. Here’s what we’re doing. We need the money. Guys, we need more. We’re planting 9,000 churches. I want to change the worship service. I need each of them to be three-and-a-half hours long now. I don’t know about parking. You fix it!“ You want me at 80 percent. I am a better man at 80 percent than I am at 100 percent. So me at 80 percent singing unto the Lord is my hands are raised and my head is up. Me singing at the top of my lungs and me bouncing a little bit; that’s me at 80 percent. Some of you at 100 percent are never going to be that. The old argument that worshiping fervently and passionately in a congregation like this makes other people look around and go, Oh, I guess the mature people raise their hands and shout and clap, and the immature people don’t. Well, that’s foolishness. No, we all passionately and fervently sing and make music to the Lord because he has commanded us to, and he indwells that. That’s what’s so heartbreaking when so many of you use the back half of our services as a reason to get out of here and get to lunch quickly. You take yourself out from under the faucet because you have elevated instruction past what it is. Now instruction is good and right, and there’s a place for it in the gathering, but we have come here to worship the living God, to interact with the living God, to experience the living God, to get ourselves under that faucet and hope he turns it on. You do that with singing and worshiping after hearing the goodness and grace of God and what he has for us in Christ. That attracts the manifest presence of God, and oh, that we might be able to get over ourselves. You know, David got caught up in the Lord so much one time that he took off his clothes. He was just wearing his ephod. He danced around among all the people of Israel, and his wife rebuked him and said he was looking like a fool. He rebuked her back. He said, ”Woman…“ I don’t know how these guys got away with that back in that day. If I said, ”Woman!“ I would have to call one of our elders and go, ”Hey, can I stay with you tonight. I don’t want to explain.“ It would just be awful. David said, ”Woman, I’ll be coming more undignified than this. You think me in this ephod dancing around is bad. I’ll get worse than this! If I get the presence of God, I’m all in.“ I think so many of us just don’t want to look foolish. I can tell you this. God is never going to go, ”All right. You’re just kind of making too big of a deal about me. I am not that great! Everybody calm down. That’s a little loud. We’re doing some things over here. We’re trying to concentrate.“ It’s an incense into the throne of heaven. He inhabits the praise of his people. He commands us to enter with singing and rejoicing. This is what we’re commanded to do. This is what we’re asked to do by God. This attracts the manifest presence of God. Now again I have to keep going back to this. Does that mean that if we’re walking in personal and corporate holiness and we enter into his courts with praise that the faucet will get turned on? No, but it puts us right under it. It puts us right under it. Now what repels the manifest presence of God? Two things, and we have to move quickly. 1. Pride. Psalms 138:6: ”For though the Lord is high, he regards the lowly, but the haughty he knows from afar.“ So let me explain this, because I know we’re young and there’s slang that’s permeated the church. When God uses the word haughty, he is not talking about someone who is attractive. He is saying the haughty, the proud, the boastful. I know some of those 20-year-olds down at the Dallas Campus are like, It’s not my fault I’m gorgeous. In the end, he is saying the proud, the boastful he knows from afar. Now that’s not omnipresence. That’s special presence. ”The proud, the boastful, I know from afar.“ Here’s what’s sad. The haughty don’t care. They don’t think they need it. They don’t think they need the manifest presence of God. They don’t think their sin is that big of a deal. They live under the illusion of control. Isn’t it interesting that when everything is going well in our world, we’re proud of ourselves? Come on. We can be straight. We’re friends, right? Things at home are good, and the checkbook looks decent, and the kids are kind of behaving. We’re getting along with our roommates. We’re not fighting with anybody at work. We’re kind of proud of us. We’re kind of getting into the swing of things. Things are in a good rhythm right now. This is the kind of stuff we say! Then when things fall apart, we’re like, ”God, what in the world are you doing?“ This is haughtiness. This is pride. This is the illusion of control. This is, I have this. It repels the manifest presence of God. Then one more, and I have to land the plane. 2. Complacency or indifference. Proverbs 1:32 through 33: ”…the complacency of fools destroys them; but whoever listens to me will dwell secure…“ If you have your Bibles, go over to Matthew, chapter 25. I’m going to pick it up in verse 1. ”Then the kingdom of heaven will be like 10 virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, ’Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.’ Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said to the wise, ’Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’ But the wise answered, saying, ’Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.’ And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, ’Lord, lord, open to us.’ But he answered, ’Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.’ Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.“ So you have this great parable of those who go, ”I’m going to wait no matter how long it takes. I’m bringing extra oil. Who knows when he is going to show up? We’re going to be ready for when he shows up.“ Then you have some who are like, ”Well, let’s just see what happens.“ They’re not really prepared. They have a time limit on their range of waitfulness. ”I’ll wait for a bit, but he had better hurry up and get here.“ One is going, ”I’ll wait no matter how long it takes.“ One is going, ”I’ll wait for a bit. I’m definitely not burning midnight oil.“ One is going, ”I’ll bring extra oil in case I have to keep the lamp on even later than that.“ When we are indifferent or complacent about the things of God, it repels the manifest presence of God. Surely this isn’t a stretch for your imagination! How do indifference and complacency work out in your other relationships? Men, let me be straight with you. Be indifferent and complacent about your wife, you’ll find a man somewhere else start to not be indifferent toward your wife. Be complacent about your children, and you’ll wake up and your days of influence will be gone. Surely you can understand even on a human level that indifference and complacency never ends well. That’s why the Proverbs say a fool is destroyed in his complacency. If we were to come expectant, if we were to come in belief, if we were to fervently pursue like these men in the Bible do, where David goes, ”I’m seeking, I’m after, I’m thirsty, I need…“ If we’re like Moses who cries out, ”Show me your glory…“ If we’re like the apostle Paul who says he wants to know Christ and the power of his resurrection, and on and on and on I could go… For like these men who say, ”What I need is God, and I’ll surrender everything and sacrifice everything and consider everything as rubbish next to the surpassing greatness of knowing him,“ I’ll spend my life in that pursuit. So here’s how I think we need to grow individually and as a congregation. I think when we come and we gather on the weekends, we need to be better prepared. I’ll tell you what I mean by that. I think we should be more avid in our prayers during the week, and I’ll tell you why. This leads to really the second thing. Not only preparation but anticipation. Can I tell you what God does when we gather? Here are just a couple of things I personally know. God saves people. Do you know how crazy that is? People come into our doors. They’re not believers in the gospel, haven’t experienced the life change Christ brings, and God meets them and rescues them here. God heals people here, like literally bends the laws of science and miraculously heals people here. God reconciles marriages here. He exposes sin here. He stirs up affections, and he changes lives. He does it when we come together and make much of him. Why is there so little anticipation about getting here? David mourned when he got to a place where he could no longer enter into the temple. Why isn’t there an ongoing anticipation for what God might do among us as we gather? You would think we’d be in a rush to get here, try to find a good seat just to see what he might do, to get ourselves under the faucet in the hopes that he might turn it on. One of my favorite things about our story here is God has saved people who statically aren’t savable: 60-year-olds, aggressive atheists. Not just atheists but aggressive ones. Reconciled marriages. People who have been divorced for seven years who God brought back together. Called wayward people home. He has saved the lives of those who were on their last breath, who were contemplating ways out. God is at work among us. Oh that our anticipation might build for him to show up in mightier and mightier ways. So my hope is just that we’d get better at positioning ourselves under the faucet, but only he can turn it on. Let’s pray. Holy Spirit, I pray you would do now what only you can do. I pray that where our hearts are hard, where some of these words just bounced off of us, that you would give us hearts of flesh, where there is ice, that you would melt it, that you would, as the psalmist prayed in Psalms 51, restore to us the joy of your salvation, God, that you would free us up from our own dignity that we might enjoy you fully. I pray we might sing louder than usual, that we might believe more that you are who you say you are, and that you say what you do. That you would give us the grace to embrace and believe all you have promised to us in Christ. We thank you for the gospel, for forgiveness, and for your manifest presence and ask you would fall in that way among us. It’s through your beautiful name I pray, amen. Love you guys."
17,loving-god,0,"Grab your Bibles and turn to Matthew, chapter 22. That’s where we’re going to be tonight. Several years ago, a pastor friend of mine, who was teaching through the same text we’re about to teach through tonight, shared a story I thought was both hilarious and also very relevant to the central idea of this text. This pastor friend of mine shared the story about when he was in college at the University of Texas. He was with a number of roommates in an apartment, and like most male collegians, most of their apartment was built on cinder blocks. So the whole thing was kind of just poorly put together. He discovered, one day, he had an extra paycheck he didn’t know he had, which, first of all, right there, is a cardinal sin of any collegian…to let an extra paycheck go unnoticed. That’s crazy, but he found it and decided what he wanted to do was use this kind of “bonus” paycheck to help really fix up his apartment. So he cashed it and began to deliberate with his roommates about…What would they do? What does this place need to look like? What do they need to do with it? They decided, of course, as any good male college roommate would do, what the apartment really needed to enhance the place was beanbags. So he gave the money to his roommates and said, “Go out and go find, you know, as many beanbags as this will buy, and we’re going to make this place look legit.” They go out, and hours pass. Literally, hours go by. He doesn’t know where they are. They haven’t made any contact, and then finally, at the end of the day, they come rolling in. To his surprise, they didn’t come back with a bunch of beanbags. They came back with a ferret. As he is explaining this story, he said it was kind of like this Jack and the Beanstalk-type deal. I sent you out to get a cow, and you brought home beans. Like, what in the world are you doing? It was this hilarious story that paints the picture that it’s easy, in the midst of the mission we’ve been sent on to, to get distracted and end up not making the main the main thing. What you see in Matthew, chapter 22, is the same heart of that. God has put us here for a reason. He has given us a mission. We’re going to see in this text, all too often, we lose sight of the main thing God has called us to do in this time on this earth, and so Matthew 22 kind of recalibrates our hearts a little bit of what it is that is of primary importance for followers of Jesus Christ. Hopefully, tonight this will just refresh us and encourage us a bit more to fulfill this. But Matthew, chapter 22, we’ll start in verse 34, and give you a little background on the text we’re in. At this point in the gospel of Matthew, Jesus is nearing the end of his earthly ministry. It’s the culmination of his earthly ministry, and just before this passage we’re about to read, Jesus had gone into the temple, had driven out the moneychangers who were using the worship of God as a means by which they could make a profit. That righteously frustrated Jesus, he drove them out, and this didn’t sit well with a lot of the religious leaders. Matthew, chapter 22, you have a set of religious leaders who come to Jesus to try to trap him with some trick questions because they hope if Jesus will answer these questions wrong, it will do one of two things. Either, one, it will prove he’s a heretic, or two, at the very least, based upon his answer to the questions that are asked, he’ll at least split the camp of followers and divide his followers and lose popularity. In Matthew, chapter 22, you see 3 instances where he is pressed and tried to be tricked in some of these questions. The first two are by the Sadducees, and they try to trick Jesus, and Jesus just kind of punks them, puts them right down. Then here comes the Pharisees in verse 34, and the Pharisees approach Jesus and say this: “But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. And one of them, a lawyer…,” not a lawyer as we would know lawyers to be. This was a scholar of the law, of the biblical Hebrew law. “…asked him a question to test him,” in order to trick him or trap him. He asked this in verse 36: “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” Now if you remember last week, when we were in Galatians, chapter 3, we talked about the idea of what the law was. It was more than just the Ten Commandments, right? There were, in fact, about 613 commandments that governed the nation of Israel. Out of those 613, 300-plus were prohibitions, things you’re not to do; 285 of those were actual commands, things we are to do. What the religious scholars of the day, the Pharisees and Sadducees, they would get together, and they would begin to argue amongst themselves as to which ones are the greater commandments and which ones are the lesser. In other words, which ones are the misdemeanors, and which ones are the felonies, so to speak? They argued amongst themselves, and ultimately, they were asking, “Of all the commandments, what is the greatest? What is the greatest commandment? Is it the Sabbath, keeping the Sabbath day holy? Is it, ’Don’t kill someone; don’t murder’? Is it, ’You’re not to have other gods before the God’? I mean what is the greatest commandment?” And so they came to Jesus. Now oftentimes, Jesus would answer their questions because he knew they were not asking sincerely; they were asking to trap him. A lot of times, he would often answer with a parable, and he would shroud the truth in there because those who were really seeking it, they could find it, but those who were just trying to trap him, they would get lost in the parable. This time, Jesus doesn’t use a parable. Jesus knows this question is way too important to leave it vague, and so Jesus quotes here, in verse 37 and following, Deuteronomy, chapter 6, which, to a Jew, is a very famous passage in the Hebrew Bible, which contains in it, really, the foremost ordinance for the nation of Israel concerning their God. Jesus quotes it when he says this in verse 37: “And he said to him, ’You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment.” And then, in verse 39, Jesus quotes Leviticus 19 when he says, “And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” So Jesus says, essentially, if you take all 613 commandments, and you boil them down, they boil down to 2. Really, out of the two, one flows from the first. The first and great commandment is you would, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind.” Then notice in verse 40, Jesus says, “It’s on these two commandments the whole Law and Prophets depend.” In other words, you take your entire Old Testament, at that time, they all, like a door on a hinge, hinged on these two laws, with one of them being the first and the great: Love the Lord your God. Worship him with everything you have. At the end of the day, really, if you were to kind of flip this a bit, this becomes the chief barometer for a follower of Jesus Christ, and really for his church, as to what it is that defines you or should define you as a follower. In other words, if we were to just take us as individuals in this room, ask yourself…How do people know me? Am I defined by the people around me? By what central characteristic? Is it a genuine and passionate love for God, for Jesus Christ? Or are you known by something lesser that would define you as a primary quality? As a church, let’s take the church, The Village Church for a moment, or specifically this campus, how are we known in the city around us? How are we known in the communities around us? Is The Village Church known, first and foremost, as a church that passionately loves Jesus Christ and loves others around us? Is that how we’re known? If it’s not, then let me suggest we have missed the main thing. We have missed the main thing, and we’re no different from those dudes who went out and, instead of getting beanbags, got a ferret, all right? We’ve missed the main thing. So let me just, again, here tonight, what I want to do is I just want to focus in on this first and great commandment: Loving God with all our heart, all our soul, and our mind. We learn, first and foremost, the primary imperative in this statement is love. It’s not knowledge. As good as it is to love the Word of God and to study it, at the end of the day, that was meant to be a means to an end, not an end. The end is to love God. It’s not knowledge. If it were knowledge, it would be philosophy. You know, the Greek word for philosophy is philosofia, which means the love of knowledge. It’s not the end. It’s also not our ministerial activity. It’s not how much we can kind of cram into our week, and how many righteous events we can attend versus not attend others. It’s not about moral piety and how holy you and I can present ourselves throughout the week. As good as some of those things can be in and of themselves, they’re not the end. They’re a means to an end. The end, the one command, the one imperative, is to love. Listen to the apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 13 when he says, “If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.” Then he concludes that chapter by saying, “So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.” It all boils down to love. So back here, in Matthew, chapter 22, all within this one statement Jesus tells us here, it contains the what, the who, the why, and the how concerning that love, and we’ve already seen the what. The what is to love, right? But he also tells us in this statement the who, and he gives three words: “…the Lord your God…” Lord your God. It’s the idea that God doesn’t want to be simply prominent in our lives. He wants to be preeminent above everything else. He wants our love, our affections, our worship for him to be greater than anything in our lives, greater than our careers, greater than our hobbies, greater than even our own families, even our own spouses or children. The first and primary object of our affections, the center of our world by which every other thing in our life should revolve around or orbit around is centrally the love we have for him. For us, that sounds incredibly selfish, incredibly arrogant. If I were to stand up here and demand the whole world love me with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind. Love me. That would sound incredibly arrogant, asking and demanding the world’s love for a flawed human being, but for God, it’s completely different, especially when you understand the why that’s packed in this statement. Again, if you look closely, implicit in this command is the why we’re to love God. Let’s take these three terms he has given us: “…the Lord your God…” Let’s break them down into why it’s him. Now first one, the idea of Lord, in some of your Bibles, the word Lord is in all capital letters, small capital letters, right? I don’t think so in the ESV, but if you have that there, the reason is it’s letting you know that is the Hebrew equivalent in the Greek for Yahweh. This is not just any Lord. This is the covenant-keeping God. This is a God who’s faithful to his promises, who’s merciful, who’s righteous, who’s gracious, and who’s perfect in his affections. There’s no one on this earth who is more deserving of love than that kind of Lord. But not only that, he also says because he’s “…the Lord your God…” He’s Elohim. This is a different term. He is the Almighty, All-powerful. He is the Eternal, everywhere-present-at-all-times God, and that kind of God stooped down for us and loved us, but he’s not just any Lord and God. Who is he? He’s your God. He’s your God. This becomes very interesting because he’s not just some abstract phenomena we kind of meditate and kind of worship from afar, like you’re looking at a piece of art in a gallery and contemplating. It’s not that. He’s very personal. He’s our God. He says, “Love the Lord your God.” He’s the one who is faithful to us. Many of us in this room have the testimony of how God pulled you from your sin, plucked you from the pit, redeemed you by the blood of Jesus Christ, and has sealed his spirit in you as a down payment for eternity, which is to come. Most of us in this room have that story, and so for you, when you think upon your story, it’s not just that Jesus is Savior of the world; he’s your Savior. It’s not that Jesus is just the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world; Jesus is the Lamb of God who took away your sin. He took away my sin, and so our lives are filled with God’s faithfulness to us because he’s a personal God. We’re to love him above all else because he has loved us better than anyone else, more eternally, more faithfully than anyone else. No one on the face of this earth has loved us like God has. That’s why John tells us, in 1 John, that the reason we love him is because he first loved us. If it wasn’t for Jesus Christ being the model of what love is, dying for us, taking on human flesh for us, rising for us, when none of us deserved it, we would never even know what love is. He was the model. Right there, in that statement, I mean we see, so far, what we’re to do…we’re to love. We see who we’re to love…the Lord our God. We see why we’re to love him…because of who he is and what he has done for us. Now he tells us how we’re to do that, and he gives three aspects here, but really, they’re all tied into one, but he says… 1. “The first way you’re to love me is with all of your heart,” all of your heart, with all of your emotion, with all of your affection, unreservedly. This is interesting thing about this God: Because of who he is, you’re loved back from him. You don’t have to guard your heart when it comes to this God like you might have to in a human relationship, wondering how this person is going to treat me at the end of this thing. You don’t have to guard your heart with that God. I mean, you can actually let your love spill over publicly and personally in tremendous ways. This is the one God, the one relationship, whose love can actually be exhibited in a very exaggerated way and be okay. That’s the reason why, when we sing, we raise our hands and surrender. Because of all of me is yours. Everything. “You’re to love me with all your heart. Everything.” 2. He says, “You’re to love me with all your soul.” Now the root word in the Greek here is the word psuche, which means breath. It’s the same breath in the garden God breathed into the nostrils of Adam and gave him life and thus gave us life. So the idea is you’re to love God with every ounce of your soul, your breath, your life, your very being, and specifically here, in the Greek, this is used in terms of our will or our purpose, the very trajectory of our lives. Everything that defines who we are is meant to end in adoration and affection for him. 3. “You’re to love me with all your mind.” It’s the idea we’re no longer conformed to this world, right? How the world thinks about life, we don’t think that way. As Paul said, “We’re taking every thought captive unto devoted obedience to Jesus Christ.” Paul said in Philippians, “Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is good, whatever is excellent, whatever is worthy of praise, let your mind dwell on such things.” I can tell you there is nothing out there that is more true, more noble, more right, more pure, more lovely, more good, more excellent, more worthy of praise than our God. No one. Our mind is to be in worship there. These three things aren’t three separate compartments when you read them. They’re all meant to be in one. God is literally saying here, “With every faculty I’ve given you, worship me. Everything. I’m the end of that.” There’s no greater affection in your life than God, and so this is telling us, now, what God primarily wants for us is that holistic love. It’s pretty straight. It’s pretty simple right here, but it’s incredibly difficult, isn’t it? I mean you read this, and you go, Man, that sounds great. Thanks for parsing up that text for us, but how easy is that to actually do? How difficult it is to love God unreservedly with everything he deserves. It’s incredibly difficult. In our closing moments here, here’s what I would love to do: I would love to just get practical. If you find yourself at a place where your love for God in this capacity has waned, can I just share with you some very practical things of how we can steward the affections of our heart that they might go where they were meant to go, in total adoration to this God? I think before, though, we look at some of those things, the first thing you have to recognize is an attitude we have to have. It’s an understanding there is not one of us in the room who has loved God in the way he fully deserves. There’s not one of us, and so when you recognize that it should bring about a humility in you, not a pride but a humility, to fall on your knees, and the first thing we do is confess and go, “Lord, I haven’t loved you the way you deserve. I haven’t responded out of an overflow of my heart and in a way you deserve, and so I haven’t made Jesus Christ the foremost aim of my affections. Thereby, I need the power of the Holy Spirit.” This is where we go in prayer, and we beg, and we plead, and we go, “God, I need you to break my heart for you. I need you to soften my heart. I need you to take all these affections I’ve had on all these vain and temporal things and wean them and put them onto yourself.” That’s the attitude by which we must start with. But past that, truthfully, because we have been saved into a relationship with God, I think there are some key aspects in every relationship, human relationship, that apply to what it means to kindle our affections towards God. Here are just a few of them our throw our way: First of all, it goes without saying… 1. Every relationship we have on this earth requires time in order to deepen and cultivate. Quantity time and quality time. Man, that’s why I love when my family comes together over meals and when we get to sit together around a table, not that backseat and going through fast food, but a table. Y’all know what a table is? It’s a really fascinating invention. Like you’re forced to face each other. It’s really cool how that works, but we get around a table, and at the end of the day, or at the start of day, we can sit around and go, “Hey, what went on today? What are your highs? What are your lows?” I get to hear my three little girls and my wife and myself get to share, “Here are some of the things we encountered today. Here are some the challenges. Here are some of the victories we’ve seen today,” and we log that time. That’s why I love playing with my kids. I like to wrestle with them, and they’re three girls, all right? I feel sorry for them, but I have to have some sort of outlet to tackle. I enjoy that. That’s why I love every Friday, getting to go on a date with my wife for just a couple of hours, apart from anyone else, and just to be together, and it’s just time. It takes time to cultivate, to deepen. In the same way, if we’re going to grow in our relationship with God, there has to be time involved. There has to be time logged with this God who is ever available, ever accessible, and who longs to commune with his children. There has to be time involved. 2. Every relationship needs clear communication in order to thrive. I mean it’s just the basics. I’m not sharing anything new with you here, but every relationship needs clear communication. For my wife and me, communication is our tether. This past week was rough, man. We misfired, right? We have been married almost 12 years now. We have some of those weeks, and this has just been one of those seasons. Whether it’s the busyness of the pace here or whether it has been the transitions in moving back here, we’ve just had some misfires. When those happen, distance gets created between us, and we have to work extra hard to make sure we’re communicating. Otherwise, if we go long periods of time… My wife has this built-in love tank. When it starts getting empty, man, that “check engine” light goes on. You pull over. You’re dealing with it, or you’re running out of gas and you’re done. All right? So we have to make sure we communicate because when we don’t, that distance takes place, and our affections wane. You need communication. With God, it’s the same thing, as well. There has to be a reciprocal relationship taking place, whereby we come to God through his Word so we can meditate, we can read, we can discover what it is he has to say for us. Likewise, we go to him in prayer, not just with a bag of complaints or a shopping list of wishes, but so we can actually supplicate. We can actually confess. We can actually appeal. We can actually render our hearts and our affections to him in prayer. So there’s a reciprocal relationship. 3. Every relationship requires knowledge and understanding of the other. I mean that’s true, isn’t it? Now again, knowledge isn’t the end but does become a necessary means to the end of loving God. I can honestly tell you, in 12 years of marriage, I love my wife now more than I did when we first got married, and it looks a whole lot different too. Sometimes it’s not as flashy. Sometimes there’s not even as much fire, at times, it seems, but I can honestly tell you (and she is sitting right here) my love for her is much deeper than it has ever been. When we were friends, it was fun learning her likes and district likes. What’s your favorite color? Oh, what’s your favorite color? Or when we dated, it got even better because now, all of a sudden, it’s…What are you passionate about? What are your fears? And you start mining, and now in marriage, there’s a whole new foundation for us because I now have gotten to see her in different seasons of our life, as a mother to our children, as my wife, as different talents and hobbies and gifts are unpacked in her. The more we study each other, and the more I learn about her, the more she learns about me, the greater our affections grow together. The seasons where we stop studying each other, that’s where they begin to wane. Essentially, that’s what theology is. It’s the study of God, and with God, there’s not just one characteristic that defines him. God is like a diamond, where every time you study him, a different facet is revealed to you. You’ll never, in your lifetime, in my lifetime, have enough time to study all the facets, but it’s such a pleasure to start mining those Scriptures and learning about who God is rather than just picking it up on a podcast from some preacher who, really, essentially, you’re learning about his relationship with God. There’s something completely different about you mining it yourself and learning more about God. As you do, your affections are meant to grow for him, and so literally, we would call this learning to love. That’s what we’re doing. 4. Every relationship demands holiness and obedience. Now why would I say this, especially in the South, where we all struggle with aspects of legalism and morality? Because you have to understand this: In a relational context, sin is not merely a judicial concept. It’s deeply personal. When I neglect my wife, when I fail to love her the way I’ve been commanded to, when I fail to walk in biblical health with my wife, it’s not that I’ve just violated an infraction against her. It’s I’ve created distance between us. I’ve broken fellowship. First John, the whole book really is themed around that idea that when we sin as a believer, it doesn’t separate us salvifically from God, but it definitely breaks the fellowship, and what is needed in that moment is confession and repentance so we can be brought back into a healthy, affectionate relationship for him. Understand, where there is a lack of time built into a relationship with God, there’s distance. Where there’s a lack of communication with God, there’s distance. Where there is a lack of understanding and knowledge about God, there’s distance. Where there is the presence of sin and the lack of holiness, there’s distance, and so we can’t enjoy a relationship with God unless those aspects are cultivated somehow. So if you find yourself, right now, at a place where your love has been waning, maybe some of those aspects will encourage you just, at least a starting place, to initiate pursuit of the one who has pursued you first. I couldn’t close without saying this: I would bet, in this room, the number one reason why you and I fail to love God the way he deserves is because we have failed to understand the depths by which he has loved us. See until the moment you really understand how God has loved you, what he has done for you in sending Jesus Christ as your Savior, and understand, really, the implications of what that meant, you’ll never fully grasp the response that comes from that, that should come from that. I remember, several years ago, when I was in California, I heard a story that really both encouraged me and really painted a picture for me about the depth of which our heavenly Father loves us. I want to close by just sharing this story with you, and it’s a modern-day Prodigal Son story. If you’re familiar with Luke, chapter 15, and the Prodigal Son story and the son who leaves and cashes out everything and comes back. This is really a true-life, Prodigal Son story that happened in Salinas, California. In Salinas, California, there was basically a wealthy landowner. Salinas is just south of San Francisco, kind of just off the Central Valley a bit. This wealthy landowner, much like the Prodigal Son story, had two sons, one who was highly respected in the community. He was very subservient to his father, and then another one who had a bit of a rebellious streak in him, and so the older son, again, more responsible, more respected; the younger one, kind of this “Freebird” going on. From an early age, this younger brother decided that as soon as he turned 18… His dad had made a promise to them that as soon as these sons turned 18, he would cash out, basically divide the land and the property and inheritance he had and give it to them, and they could basically cash it out and run from there. From an early age the younger son, in his own heart, said, “As soon as I turn 18, I’m out of here. I’m going to grab this, and I’m going to take off, and I’m going to get as far away from here as I can.” Sure enough, as he started nearing 18, he started pressing his father about, “Man, it’s time for you to cash in. Do you remember your promise?” His dad pleaded with him because he saw the immaturity in his son, and said, “Now is not the time. Please, just hang with me three more years…four more years. Let me press into you, develop some more maturity, and then it’s yours.” The son said, “No. A promise is a promise. You said 18. I want 18.” Reluctantly, when his son turned 18, his dad made good on the promise, wrote the check, or basically gave the property... He cashed it in, in an amount for what would be, literally, today, millions of dollars. Imagine a freshman in college having millions of dollars at their disposal. So he did what any freshman would do at 18. He took the money, and he said, “I’m going to get as far away from here and as far away from my dad’s rules as I possibly can,” and he jumped on a train, and he went to New York City. As soon as he got to New York, started taking his money and just throwing it away. He grabbed him the nicest sports car he could get. He grabbed some buddies and got an elite penthouse on the top of one of the high-rises. He then began buying every kind of dating relationship money could buy. Eventually, this led to some alcohol problems, some gambling problems, and before long, he began to spend more money and actually accrue more debt than he had to pay off. Eventually, the creditors came after him. He had to move out of the penthouse. He had to let go of his sports car, and before he knew it, he was on the Upper East Side of New York wandering the streets. His alcoholism had gotten to the point that he was literally pilfering through garbage cans trying to find bottles that had remnants of alcohol still in them so he could drink. The STDs he had picked up now had covered his body in sores, and all of his friends had left him, until one day he was on the street, and he came to a reality check. If I don’t do something about this now, I’m going to die out here. He managed to bum some money off of a couple of his old friends that would buy him a train ticket back to Salinas and would buy him a couple of meals. Sure enough, he gets on, and his thought is…If I can only get back to my dad, then I can just start over, and so he takes the train ride. A couple of days pass, and he finally winds up in Salinas, gets off the train, walks into the square, and he realizes, Wait a minute. There is no way I can go see my dad face-to-face. There is no way he is going to accept me back after what I just did and after how I look. He’s just going to laugh at me and say, “I told you so.” He went into a café there and just began to weep and think about what he was going to do, and so he decided he was going to write a letter to his dad. He wrote this letter down to his dad. He went out in the streets. He actually found one of his dad’s farm workers, gave him the letter, and said, “Will you take this to my dad because I can’t bear to see him right now?” And so he did. I have a copy of the letter, and I want to read it to you. See if you can feel the angst in his soul. He said, “Father, I realize what I’ve done. I’ve wasted not only your money but my life, which was important to you. I can’t even begin to tell you about the awful things that I’ve done. I’m embarrassed. I’m at the end of my rope. I know nothing else to do but ask you if I can return home. I know that there’s no reason why you should accept me back, but I plead and I beg with you that if you would, even as a farm worker on your land, accept me back, I’ll do anything for no pay. Just for the room and board.” He said, “Father, I have just enough money to take the train that passes by our ranch in front of the apple orchard near the edge of the property. I’m going by there on the train tomorrow at 1:00 p.m., and if you would accept me back, I would ask that you simply drape an old sheet over one of the trees nearest the railroad, and as I’m passing by, I’ll see the signal, and I’ll know you’ve accepted me to come home. If that sheet is not there, then I won’t stop at the train station. I’ll just keep going. You see, I can’t bear to see you face-to-face. I don’t have the courage. I’ve done too much, and I have no idea what’s going to happen with the rest of my life. Your son.” Imagine being in that position. A whole sleepless night went by filled with anxiety for this young man. The next morning he jumped on the train. As soon as he got to the train, he walked to the very back of the train, and he sat down next to this old man, and he just put his face in his hands and just began to weep as he contemplated what he may or may not see. He began to share with the old man his story about the things he had done and how he was coming back. Soon enough, as the train passed outside of Salinas and got to the outside edge of the town around where their ranch was, he looked to the old man, and he said, “Can you do me favor? Can you just go to the window, and just tell me if you see one sheet anywhere in this apple orchard? I can’t bear to look,” and so the old man jumped up. He went to the window, and he looked out. Then he looked back at the young man, and he said, “I think you need to come see this for yourself.” When he jumped up, he went to the window, and he looked out, and behold, as far as his eye could see for five square miles, there was a sheet on every tree. Jeremiah said God has loved us with an everlasting love. God says, “You want to know how much I love you? Is the sun not enough? Is the moon not enough? Are the food and shelter you have not enough? Is the air you breathe not enough? Then how about this? How about I actually send my own Son to die in your place so you can be with me?” I mean, if you’re love has waned, be reminded you serve a God who, while we were still sinners, sent Christ to die for us, who has an everlasting love that is unparalleled by any human love you’ll ever experience, and then you’ll find your heart in a place of worship. Let’s pray. Father, we just confess we fall short. When I contemplate the love by which you have loved me, I am very aware of the fact that I don’t love you as you deserve. Father, for any of us in this room who are in that place, we just appeal to your Holy Spirit. We want to cling to the one who did perfectly love you, to Jesus Christ. We want to ask that your Spirit, right now, in this room, might break our hearts, might soften our hearts, might show us the love by which you’ve given us, and Father, our affections might rise to you as we sing this song. I pray we would do so unashamedly, boldly, publicly, for knowing that no one has loved us more fully and perfectly as you have loved us in Jesus Christ. For that, we worship you in his name, amen."
18,the-difference-between-amazement-and-faith,0,"I want to speak this morning on “Seven Ways of Pleasing Jesus.” Sorry, I’m just not mature enough to resist a moment like that. If you’re God’s child, if in fact you have been saved by His grace, if you consider yourself a believer in Jesus Christ, there is one thing you need to know, that God hasn’t chosen any of His children to be just consumers of the faith. This isn’t Our Holy Church of Macy’s where I shop around and I’m looking for a place that feels comfortable for me, and if I like the music and I can tolerate the preacher, I’ll stay, but the minute something goes on that I don’t like, I’m down the road again. I have a me-centered, passivistic way of dealing with the faith. No, no, no, it’s God’s intention that all of His children not only are witness to the amazing, gracious, glorious, loving, transforming work of His kingdom, but that all of His children would be participants in the work of His kingdom. I realize that as He comes to me, He forgives me, He welcomes me into His family, He also takes ownership over me, ownership over everything in my life. My life does not belong to me anymore. I belong to the Lord. All of my gifts, all of my strengths, all of my talents, all of my resources, everything is His for His use. That’s the radical change in my life. I’m not a consumer of neat spiritual things while I hold on to my life, I hold on to my abilities, I hold on to my talents and occasionally I step out of my little safe life into this thing called spirituality. No, no, no. That means that you need to understand that it’s not really the job of the church to schedule ministries for you. Because it’s not like you step out of your life into ministry and are involved in ministry for a moment only to step back out of ministry into your life. No, it’s God’s intention that ministry would become your life. It’s God’s intention that every dimension of human life is at once a forum for ministry. Relationship is ministry. Work is ministry. Leisure is ministry. Parenting is ministry. Marriage is ministry. Those are all forums for ministry. Now having said that, it’s important to ask the question: How does God craft faith in us, so as we embrace Him by faith and we live by faith, we then become useful tools in His hands? How does He craft faith in us? How does He work to prepare us for this life now, not lived for our little kingdoms, but lived for His kingdom? How does He do that? Well I want to leave that question out there for you and make an observation that may not seem like it connects, but trust me it will later. Here it is. There is a significant, even profound difference between amazement and faith. I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where my kids grew up. And we live about and hour from the Jersey Shore. So like many Philadelphia families, we would take vacation week down at the Jersey Shore. We would go to Ocean City, New Jersey with our children, hang out on the beach and pick up medical waste. I just told my children those were seashells. They have the weirdest collection of seashells. We would hang out at Ocean City because it was a nice family place, but the next community down the beach was Wildwood, New Jersey. Wildwood has a huge boardwalk, and on that boardwalk are three big amusement parks. Our children would always beg us to go to the amusement parks and we would always have a night at Wildwood. Well in one of those amusement parks, there is a ride that is essentially this big metal frame. From it hangs these huge elastic bands. At the base of it is a big pouch that they belt a human being into, and they pull this thing back and launch this willing but delusional human being into the night. And they fly back and forth. It’s the kind of ride that you would tweet somebody and say, “I rode this ride, paid $7 and almost died!” Now that ride amazes me. The first time I saw it, I my mouth was agape. My family realized I wasn’t with them and when they came back, I was still just standing there in awe. Now that ride amazes me, but you will not strap Paul Tripp into that pouch and launch him over the Atlantic Ocean. It’s not going to happen. There is a significant difference between amazement and faith. You had better recognize that difference. Now I want you to turn to Mark 6. This is an interesting, provocative little vignette in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. Let me tell you what’s happening in the book of Mark coming up to this moment. Jesus has collected a group of followers and called them His disciples. Those men were not so much meant to be witnesses of the work of the incarnation, Jesus coming to earth; they were meant to be participants in its work. So Jesus is not so much just trying to inform them so they would understand the theology of His coming, so they would just have these big theological brains. No, Jesus was meaning to transform them by His grace so they would become different human beings, men who live in a radically different way. That’s what He was doing. So although these guys didn’t fully grasp it, they were in the 24/7 school of discipleship. They were being discipled every moment. The typical way that they were being discipled is Christ would put them in a moment of difficulty where there was some circumstance or some need that was way beyond their ability, and just when they would about to be confused or despair, He would reveal His glory, the glory of His power, the glory of His compassion, the glory of His grace. It was that combination of difficulty and glory that was meant to change them. Because they weren’t just to be informed; they were to be transformed by His grace. There is in Mark a bit of a gospel equation. It’s this; Divine Power + Divine Compassion = Everything You Need. That’s suitable for your morning mirror. DP + DC = EYN. This is what’s going on. There is a God of awesome power, who, because of divine compassion, has invaded my life, and that means He will deliver to me all things that I need. And that thought is meant to propel me, to begin to transform the way I think about my identity and I think about who I am, I think about what I need, I think about how I am meant to live life. Divine Power + Divine Compassion = Everything You Need. Now let me read for you from Mark 6, beginning with verse 45. “Immediately [Jesus] made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. And after he had taken leave of them, he went up on the mountain to pray. And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land. And he saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them, but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out, for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, ”Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.“ And he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded, for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.” Now check this out. The disciples find themselves in another one of these moments of difficulty. They’re trying to cross the Sea of Galilee, they’re facing an impossible headwind, they’re in the midst of an angry sea, they are unable to get where they’re trying to go, according to the time given in the passage they had probably had been rowing for eight hours, they’re utterly exhausted, they’re utterly frustrated and they’re in an impossible, futile and dangerous situation way beyond their ability. Now when you look at that kind of historical moment in Scripture, you should ask yourself the question, “How did these people get into this mess? How is it that these people arrived at this seemingly impossible, clearly futile and potentially dangerous moment?” And look at verse 45. It says, “Immediately [Christ] made his disciples get into the boat.” The disciples were not in this moment because they had been unwise, they were not in this moment because they had been unfaithful, they were not in this moment because they had been disobedient and they were not in this moment because they had been self-interested. They were in this moment because they had been commanded to be in this moment. They were in this moment because they were obeying the clear call of Christ. Now this tells you something radical that you need to understand. Jesus wanted them in this moment. This moment was not in the way of His work of transformation. This moment was not outside of that divine power and that divine compassion. This moment was not an obstacle of the good thing that He was trying to do in them. This moment is part of the plan. Jesus knows exactly what He’s doing. He knows exactly where they will be. He knows all about the wind and the waves. This is the Lord God Creator. He’s not surprised. When you get that, you have to ask, you have to be authentic and integrity when you read the Bible, you should ask tough questions of the Bible and you should say, “Why? Why would a God of mercy, why would a God of compassion, why would a God of power, why would a God of grace and love ever choose any of His children to be in this kind of moment? I thought God loved me? I thought He was with me? I thought He was the great Deliverer? I don’t understand.” Well here’s what Jesus knows. He knows the hearts of His disciples and He’s seen the empirical evidence of that heart demonstrated before Him. He knows how self-reliant we can be. He knows how secure we are in our strength and our own wisdom. He knows how amazed we are by our own character. He knows that so often we are way too trustful of ourselves. So here’s what He will do. God will take us where we have not intended to go in order to produce in us what we could not achieve on our own. We had better begin to teach and encourage and comfort one another with a theology of uncomfortable grace. Because often this side of eternity, God’s grace comes to me in uncomfortable forms. Oh I long for the grace of relief and someday that will come, but right now what I actually need is the grace of refinement. I need to be changed. I need to be transformed. I need to become a person of faith. That means everything I do is based on a deep and abiding belief that God is and He’s glorious and He’s loving and He’s kind and He’s powerful. And I find hope and rest in Him and Him alone. That’s what I need to become. So in love, He will take me beyond my wisdom, beyond my strength, beyond the bounds of my character, beyond my righteousness and He will cause me to throw myself on Him. That’s not God forgetting me. That’s not God beating me up. That’s not God being unfaithful and inattentive. The Bible calls that grace. I’m being rescued, I’m being restored, I’m being loved, I’m being changed. He loves me and He will not turn from His work and He will continue and continue till that work is complete. That’s grace. God will take you where you haven’t intended to go in order to produce in you what you could not achieve on your own. Those moments of difficulty in the life of a believer are sure signs of redemptive love. That’s what they’re about. Now what happens next in this little vignette is just mind-boggling. Look at the middle of verse 48. “And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.” Say what? He did what? Why would He do such a thing? What does this tell us about the person Jesus and what He’s seeking to accomplish? You need to ask that question. You need to unpack this moment. Now think with me. Jesus clearly sees and understands the difficulty of the disciples. He sees that they’re in trouble, He sees that they’re in this discouraging, futile and potentially dangerous moment. If all He wanted to do was relieve the pressure of the moment, all He had to do was pray a prayer from the shore and it would have been over. The sea would calm, the wind would die, things would get happy, they would be able to row the boat to shore and everything is cool. But that’s not what He does. While the wind is still powerfully blowing, while the waves are still crashing, while the disciples are still in that futile moment, Jesus, as Lord of creation, walks across the angry sea, walks into the powerful wind, He walks by the disciples. It says He passed by them. It’s not that He’s ignoring them, but He walks far enough so that all the disciples can see Him. What is He doing? Yes, God is a God of mercy and there are clear moments where, in love, He will deliver you from situations of difficulty, but He wants to do more for you. He’s not so much after your situation, He’s after you. And He wanted His disciples in this deep, frustrating moment to get something that they could get no other way. So He walks out onto the water so they can see Him, because He wants to demonstrate something that is meant to transform the way they think about themselves and transform the way they think about life. Now look what it says. It says when they all saw Him walking on the sea, “they all sang a hymn together.” Is that how your Bible reads? No, it says, “When they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out, for they all saw him and were terrified.” Now these guys have been with Jesus. They had seen incredible miracles. They had watched Him raise a little one from the dead. They saw Him feed this massive crowd with a little boy’s lunch. They had seen His glory, they had seen His power, they had experienced His compassion. Why were they utterly unprepared for this moment? Why, in a moment when they should have been heartful and peaceful and full of joy, were they terrified? Why were they unprepared? I think what is true of those disciples in that moment is often true of us. Even though we claim to be God’s children, in moments of difficulty, we’re more skilled at seeing ghosts than we are at seeing our Father and our response is more terror than hope. Why? As this is all going on, as the sea is angry, as the wind is blowing, as the storm is still going on, as the disciples are terrified, Jesus speaks to them and says, “It is I. Do not be afraid.” Now in your English translation, it’s hard to get the sense of what Jesus is doing here. The man Christ Jesus, who is also the Son of God, is in this moment taking a name of God. He says, “Don’t you understand? I AM is with you. The God who was and is and will ever be the same, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God who has made covenant with you, the God whose covenant is now fulfilled in My person, I AM is with you. You have hope, not because you’re wise, not because you’re strong, not because life is peaceful. You have hope because I AM is in your life. And now there’s hope because of the invasion of My presence. By grace, you are never in a situation alone, you are never in a relationship alone, you are never in life alone. I AM is with you. I AM in glory and in grace has invaded your life. There’s hope.” And then Jesus gets in the boat with the disciples. He speaks to the storm and it dies down. And the Bible says that the disciples were utterly amazed. Now that sounds almost like a compliment, but we’ll learn in the next verse that it’s actually a critique. Now let me explain amazement to you. Amazement is when you have been taken beyond any categories that you have to understand or explain something. The disciples shouldn’t have been amazed. They had watched this One operate. They should have been increasingly being transformed by the display of power and compassion that was demonstrated every day in their lives. But they’re amazed. Let me give you sort of a dumb illustration of amazement. Pretend with me that you’re outside this building one afternoon and up drives the most amazing European sports car you’ve ever seen. This thing just has gorgeous lines. It would get you attention even if you’re not a car person at all. It’s bright yellow and it’s about four feet high at its tallest point. And the man who’s in the car is more laying down than sitting down and He pulls up, turns off the engine and these gull-wing doors open up and he slides out. And you’re just interested in so you say, “Could I just sit in the car for a moment?” And you sit in the car and the inside of it looks more like a jet cockpit than it does an automobile. You slide your way out, stretch your back and you’re walking around the car and you say, “I know this might be impolite, but I just can’t help ask. How much is this car worth?” And he says, “Well about $495,000.” At that moment, you’re impressed. And then he says, “I’ve got to go.” He gets into the car, presses the button, the gull-wing doors come down, he turns on the engine, that 12-cylinder engine roars that deep roar, he puts the car in gear and it levitates out of sight. Now you’re amazed. You have no categories for understanding what just went on. You’re looking at the guy next to you asking yourself, “Did he see the same thing I saw?” There is a critical difference between amazement and faith. Amazement is a function of the brain. Faith is an investment of the heart that changes the way that I live. You can be amazed by the preaching of Matt Chandler and not live by faith. You can be amazed at the loving community that is the Village Church and not be living by faith. You can be amazed at all the wonderful Christian music that’s now available to us that causes our hearts to worship and not be living by faith. You can be amazed at all the ministries that you can participate here and not be living by faith. You can be amazed by the logic of a theology of Scripture that is so gorgeous and not be living by faith. You can be amazed by the grand redemptive story and not be living by faith. There is a critical difference between amazement and faith. Amazement is something you do with your brain. Faith is an investment of your heart that changes the way you live your life. Why in this moment was the response of the dear disciples not one of faith? Why was it one of terrified amazement? Well the passage tells us. Mark doesn’t make many editorial comment, but he makes one here. He says, “For they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.” That little phrase “they did not understand about the loaves” refers back to the feeding of the five thousand. In that moment where Jesus takes a little boy’s lunch and turns it into a meal for a large crowd, Jesus is demonstrating that He is the bread of life and as the bread of life He will make provision for you that will finally satisfy your heart. And when Mark says they didn’t understand the loaves, it’s a short-hand for saying they didn’t learn their lessons, they weren’t learning, they weren’t understanding, they weren’t gripping a hold of, they weren’t living out of this great demonstration that Christ was making for them again and again as He willingly put them in difficulty and willingly showed them His glory so that they would be transformed, so that they would live out of a new identity and by living out of a new identity, they would realize that they had new potential and would live in radical new ways wherever He would place them. They weren’t learning their lessons. And Mark tells us why. It’s because they had a hard heart. It’s possible to be a believer in Jesus Christ and have a hard heart. Hebrews 3:12-13 warns believers against a hard heart. Now it’s a word picture. The Bible talks about the stony heart. Think about this. what’s being described there? Well if I had a rock this big in my hands right now and I would press it with all of my strength, there’s no way that I would be able to change the shape of that rock. Because stone isn’t malleable. So that picture of a hard heart, that picture of a stony heart is a picture of a heart that is resistant to change. It is actually resistant to this unrelenting, transforming work that Jesus is seeking to do in my life. Now why would I be resistant to change? I think the sweep of Scripture would tell us that I’m typically resistant to change because I’m okay with where I am. I’m okay with what I know, I’m okay with a marriage that is a little bit better than a war zone, I’m okay being a little bit in debt although that debt reveals the materialism in my heart, I’m okay with terminally casual relationships with the body of Christ and although I’m here a lot no one knows me, I’m okay that I’m occasionally greedy, envious and jealous because I don’t really steal things from people, I’m okay that I check out women in the mall in ways that I shouldn’t because I hadn’t really committed physical adultery. I’m okay with where I am. And why can we be okay? Because of our ability to deceive ourselves. Let me play this out for you. I say this all the time. Whenever I say it, people laugh. You probably will too. No one’s more influential in your life than you are, because no one talks to you more than you do. You see, you’re in a constant conversation with yourself. And the things that you say to you, about you are very, very important. They are very formative of the way you respond to life. So if you’re a believer and you do something that’s wrong, you’re conscience will bother you. That’s the beautiful convicting ministry of the Holy Spirit. And when your conscience bothers you, you only have one of two possibilities. You will confess that thing as being wrong and you will place yourself once again under the justifying mercies of Christ and receive His forgiveness. Or you will erect some system of self-justification that makes that wrong acceptable to your conscience. We’re so good at doing that. So a man who is at the mall lusting will tell himself, “It’s not lust. I’m just a man who enjoys beauty.” A woman who’s on the phone in a long conversation of gossip will end the conversation by saying, “We should pray,” and tell herself that that was a very extended and detailed personal prayer request. A parent who has just screamed at one of his children will say, “I wasn’t angry. I was just being like one of God’s prophets.” A man who is on an ugly quest for personal power will say, “I’m just exercising God-given leadership gifts.” We get to this point of contentment because we will not face how desperately the reality is of our continuing need for God’s forgiveness. So in the face of conviction, we bombard ourselves with self-atoning arguments. Here’s what they do. They make us feel okay about things that are not okay. And when you do that, you sit there and you feel like you’ve arrived. I’m about to hurt your feelings now. There’s not a grace graduate in this room. Paul uses a very interesting term in 2 Corinthians 10 for this dynamic. He talks about the fact that there are these pretenses that get in the way of our knowledge of God. What’s a pretense? A pretense is a plausible lie. If I were to say to you that in my early years I was a female Olympic gymnast, that’s a lie. But it lacks plausibility. . .I hope. But if I stood outside this building with a beautiful suit, an expensive leather briefcase, some architectural drawings and a little bit of structural vocabulary, I could fool you for a while that I was an architect. Because that lie has some plausibility. So as you tell yourself self-atoning lies, you never tell yourself a bad lie. The reason you’re able to do that is because there’s always something to point to. You do live in a fallen world that does not operate how it’s intended and you do live around flawed people who are messing up. So you have plenty of people and situations to point to, and as you do that, you are convincing yourself that your biggest problems in life are outside of you and not inside of you. And once you convince yourself of that, you quit being excited about transforming grace because frankly you don’t think you need it because you’ve arrived. You say, “Paul, I sort of get what you’re talking about, but help me here.” Here are these men who had been chosen by God to be part of the most beautiful thing that you could ever be part of. It’s a kingdom that radically changes people. It’s a kingdom of grace, love, forgiveness, restoration and reconciliation. And yet as the redeemer has invaded their life to help them begin to place their meaning and purpose, their inner sense of wellbeing, their goal for their living, their rest and hope in His hands, they’re okay with where they are, they’re hard-hearted men. Well let me illustrate this with a little bit of a family story. When he was young, our oldest son Justin just didn’t understand the concept of gifts. It drove me crazy. We would buy Justin a gift that we thought he would enjoy, he’d rip open the gift, pull it out, discard it and he’d play with the box. It just made me crazy. So after a couple of years of that, Luella and I decided that we would go one Christmas on a quest to find the quintessential Justin gift. Were were going to find a gift that this kid would love, that he would enjoy, that he would play with. We were probably out there looking way longer than two rational people should have, but I was going to have us stay out there. We finally found this toy that we thought, “This is a Justin toy. He will love this. He will play with this.” When it came to that moment at Christmas for him to open that gift, we were clearly more excited than he would have ever been. He tore into the gift like a little boy would, not thinking of recycling, and he pulled out the toy and actually began to play with it. I had such a feeling of victory. I went into the kitchen for a moment to get something to drink, talked briefly with one of the other members of my family, went back into the living room and he was playing while sitting in the box. Now you say, “Why is this man telling us this cute family story?” You have been given, you have been offered the most awesome gift that could ever be given. It’s a gift that’s gorgeous from every perspective. You can turn it any way you want, you can walk around it anyway you want and there is nothing but beauty in this gift, stunning beauty. It’s the one gift that, whether they know it or not, every human being needs. It’s the one gift that has the power to radically change you, to radically change your thoughts, to radically change your desires, to radically change your words, to radically change your actions, reactions and responses. It is the awesome, glorious gift of gifts. It’s the gift of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. But there are many of us who sadly are content to play with the box. We’re content with a little theological insight. We’re content with a little bit of biblical literacy. We’re content with a little bit better marriage, a little bit more insightful parenting. We’re content with contributing a little bit of our money to God’s work. We’re content with the feeding we get on Sunday morning. I am deeply persuaded that the problem with many of us is not dissatisfaction, the problem with many of us is not discontent, but the problem with many of us is we’re all too easily satisfied. We don’t hunger for more of the work of this gift. We’re not holding on to this gift of grace with both hands saying, “I am not going to let go of this gift of grace. I’m going to be wherever it’s promoted, wherever it’s explained. I want to hang with people who love this gift. I want to hear the teaching of this gift. I want to live in light of this gift. I’m not letting go of this gift of grace until it has done everything it can do in my life. I love this gift of grace. It is my priceless treasure, Jesus and His grace.” Isaiah 55 says that’s exactly what God intends to do. He intends to radically transform me. There is in Isaiah 55 this weird little word picture. It’s talking about the rain and snow of the word of God coming down, and it says when the rain and snow of God’s word comes down, the thorn bush becomes a cyprus and the briar becomes a myrtle. Now that’s a weird word picture. If you have a little thorn bush in your backyard and rain comes down on it and nourishes it, what do you expect to get? A bigger thorn bush. When rain comes down on a little briar, you expect to get a bigger briar. But the Bible is saying that, as God works by His grace through His word, I become, at the level of my heart, organically different, I become something else. I don’t become a better me; I become, by grace, a radically different me. This is not your best self now. I don’t need to be a better me; I need to be delivered from me, I need to be transformed into something different. That means that lustful people become pure people, greedy people become giving people, angry people become peaceful people, controlling people become serving people, anxious people become restful people because I AM has invaded our lives by His grace and He will transform us into something different. You must settle for nothing less. You must not stop along the way. Because I don’t know about you, but this week I gave empirical evidence that I am yet in need of further transformation and the work isn’t done. So I want to pastor you for a moment. If I would watch the video of your past couple weeks, would I say that you are celebrating, you are holding on to that gift of grace with both hands, wanting it to do everything that it is able to do in you? Or are you content to play with the box? Are you content with a little bit of faith, a little bit of external Christianity, a couple lumps of change here and there, but you’re okay with you? Maybe you’re a believer in Jesus Christ, knowledgeable and intentionally and this morning you would say, “Paul, that’s me. There are really times when I esteem this gift of grace, when I’m blown away that I AM has invaded my life. In those moments, I long for this grace to transform me. But Paul, there are times when I don’t care. I would rather have life be easy and predictable. And in those moments, I don’t esteem this gift of grace and I am pretty content with playing with the box.” I would say this to you. Don’t wallow in shame. Don’t be paralyzed by regret. You, because of the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, because He has purchased your forgiveness for every sin in the past, present and future, you in your brokenness, with your fickle, rebellious heart, with your lack of care, can run into His presence and be utterly unafraid. Because He will not reject you. He will receive you, and He will forgive you by His grace. He will not only forgive you; He will work change in you. Run to Him. Run to Him this morning. Maybe you’re here and you say, “Paul, if I were honest, I have never exercised that faith. I don’t think I’ve ever believed. I think I’ve lived a pretty comfortable, self-reliant life. I don’t know if I have belief in me.” The Bible says that by grace that faith is a gift of God. Run to Him. Run to Him and confess your self-reliance, your independence. And He says if you come to Him, He will never ever turn you away. There is no more stunning reality in the universe than that a holy God would invade the mess of our existence to transform us by His grace. So we get rescued from us and the mess we would make of our lives to live for something grand and glorious, the transforming purposes of His kingdom. If you were honest, would you say, “I love that gift of grace. It is the most valuable, motivating thing in my life”? Or are you content to play with the box? Let’s pray. “Oh Lord, we thank You for the beauty and clarity of this passage of Scripture we looked at. It’s like a mirror that we look into and see ourselves. We are so like those disciples. But we thank You for more than that. We thank You for the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the I AM, who would invade our lives by His grace, who would redefine who we are, who would by grace not only forgive us, but give us a new identity and in giving us a new identity, give us a whole new potential. May we be worshipfully dissatisfied until Your grace has done all that it is able to do. We pray this for the sake of Your children. We pray this for the sound of Your glory. We pray this in the sweet and strong name of Jesus. Amen.”"
19,biblical-faith,0,"Good morning. My name is Adam Thomason. I am one of the ministering shepherds down at the Dallas campus. Today is indeed a privilege to share with you. I do not come to you in a condescending manner. I do want to warn you I am a pretty passionate, some have labeled me a ferocious preacher. But I would say that’s not in condescension, that’s not saying I’ve obtained some status. I preach with a veracity because I believe that Satan uses that very veracity to get us to believe lies, and to me not to communicate that passion is a misnomer to God’s word and His truth. So when I preach, I do preach out of a passion and a plea. I don’t preach out of a frustration and a condemnation. Today’s message is going to be kind of like a $30 type sushi buffet. I’m not talking about the $6 buffet; I’m talking bout the $30 buffet. When you go into the buffet, you’re like, “Where do is start?” In preparing this message, it was kind of like, “The Word of God is so good, where do I start? I could preach out of here. I could talk out of Leviticus. I could talk about Chronicles.” I’m like, “Lord, what do You have for me to preach.” So the message today is really something that He laid on my heart before, but as I sought the Lord and listened to the Colossians study and I looked at what JR did last week, I really believe that this is the message that He laid on my heart, not as a generic message but as one of a prophetic message for the church in America, the church locally. It is really something that He has broken me of and is still breaking me of. So kind of like Nehemiah, I don’t say, “Lord forgive them of their sins.” Nehemiah says, “Forgive us of our sins.” So I really do see this as an honor. It’s kind of like gumbo. I like cooking. If you have cooked gumbo, there are a lot of things that go into the gumbo, shrimp, chicken, vegetables. But if the sauce or the roux is not right, you’re not going to have a good gumbo. We’re going to be talking about a lot of things when it comes to this message, but the sauce or the roux is going to be faith. I’m going to be talking about what a biblical faith is and what a counterfeit faith is. I might refer to the counterfeit faith as a pseudo-faith, a westernized faith, a capitalistic faith. So without further ado, let’s get into the Scriptures. We’re going to look at John 4:36-38. “The one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. For here the saying holds true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’ I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.” Let’s pray. “Lord, I thank You for this time. I thank You that You have destined all of us to be here in this moment. Lord, our prayer right now is that You would allow the hearts of men and women in this building to be open to Your message, open to the gospel. I pray that You speak mightily. In Jesus’ name we pray. Amen.” One of the things I love to do is look at culture. Two channels I would love to have on television: The Food Network and Animal Planet. I love to look from Animal Planet’s perspective how God has wired these animals so uniquely and how they just naturally testify to His greatness. In 2004 I had the privilege of being on a missionary team in which we got to plant a ministry in Mombasa, Kenya. Then our missionary there surprised us with going on a safari. Now you’ve got to know a little bit about this missionary. He’s kind of a penny counter. So as we’re talking about going on this safari, I’m thinking that it’s going to be a very ghetto type safari. I’m think that we’re going to have to show up and sign a waiver, we’re going to be riding 10-speed bikes and stay together. So lo and behold we get there and we’re in this van. Our guide comes and we pull up and see the African Impala. He says about the African Impala, “Do you see that Impala right there? It’s a very graceful creature, a very elegant creature. But it’s a very powerful creature. It’s one of the most powerful creatures pound for pound.” We say, “Do tell. Why do you say that?” He says, “Because for the size of the African Impala and what the African Impala can do, it’s flooring. An African Impala can jump ten feet high and cover a distance of thirty feet effortlessly.” But then he goes on to say, “If you change the situation or the circumstances, that same African Impala will not jump a wall as high as three feet and will only cover a distance as far as seven feet. See the zoo.” He said, “Naturally there is no reason why an African Impala should be in the zoo if it knew what its inherent ability was despite its circumstances.” And then He left us with this. He says, “Oh how limitless it would be for the African Impala if its greatness was not dictated by its circumstances. It would truly know no bounds.” When I heard that and thought, “There’s a sermon in there somewhere; I just don’t know how.” So six years later it hit me. I would substitute the disciple of Christ for the Impala. Oh how limitless it would be for the disciple of Christ if its greatness, its inherent power bestowed upon us from Jesus Christ was not to its circumstances. Oh how great it would be for the disciple of Christ if our faith was not limited to our circumstances. We would truly know no bounds or restrictions. So we’re going to be talking about biblical faith vs. a counterfeit faith. As we approach this passage, Christ has just gotten done talking to the woman at the well. The woman a the well is excited, so she goes on and tells many people about Christ. In the meantime, if you backup to verse 31, there is a dialogue going on between the disciples and Christ. The disciple says, “Rabbi, you need to eat something.” Then Christ says, “You know what? I have food that you’re not aware of?” Then they respond to one another, “Hey, we’ve been with this guy the whole time. Did somebody buy Him something to eat?” And then in response, emphatically Jesus says, “My food is to do the will of the Father.” He’s saying, “There is a supernatural element to where ministry in the kingdom of God sustains Me, not what man does. Even what’s in My flesh, I can go on without meals because it’s not the meal that keeps me going; it’s the kingdom, it’s to do the work of the One who sent Me and to accomplish that.” And then He continues on and says, “Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months, then comes the harvest’?” What He’s trying to say is, “Don’t you even understand that there is work that has to be done until the harvest comes?” And they would say, “yeah” in a rhetorical sense. He says, “Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest. Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.” The immediate context in which I want to talk about first is the faith biblically of the sower, which I think biblically is the faith that Christ calls us to. You see, when we look at the sower in this passage, you might be asking the question, “Who is the sower?” Well let us back up. Before then, with the woman at the well, He talked to Nicodemus and said, “Nicodemus, stop focusing on the flesh. Focus on the spiritual element.” Then back up to chapter 2 with the miracle at Canaan. He says, “It’s not about what you see. I have power over creation as well.” He turns water into wine. Back up from there to chapter 1 and it says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Christ is the Word. “He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men.” And then it goes on to say this, “There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light,. . .” They call John the Baptist the forerunner. The forerunner’s job is to make level the paths of the king. So John the Baptist was called to make the paths straight and level. So when they talk about the sower and the reaper, when He says, “. . .so that sower and reaper may rejoice together,” when He says, “I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor,” He’s talking about immediately someone specific, and then He’s talking about something specific in a macro sense. The first person He’s talking about is John the Baptist. John the Baptist wore camel’s hair. Now some of you may not get that. I’ve got an undergrad degree in fashion design. Camel’s hair is not the latest trend. It wasn’t then, and it isn’t now. That was a sign to the outside world saying, “I reject this world, and I long even in my clothing for the return of Jesus Christ.” So he wore camel’s hair. He wasn’t in the “in” crowd. He wasn’t cool. Then it says that he lived in the desert. So he wasn’t part of the metropolis. He wasn’t going with the ebb and flow of society. His location showed where he longed for the appearance of Jesus Christ. And then it says he ate wild locusts and honey. I don’t care what scholar you are, it could be literal locusts or it could be vegetarian locusts, that is not a diet that any of us want to be on. So from his  dress, from his location and even his diet, he’s saying, “My food is not the will of man; it’s to do the will of the One who sent me.” So he sows that. He’s out there proclaiming the kingdom. He’s giving his life to that. He’s sowing and sowing and sowing. And he has a faith that, “It may not make a return in my lifestyle, but it will in the lives of others.” And if you know anything about John the Baptist, he was beheaded. Why do I initially talk about John the Baptist in the context of the sower and the reaper? Because when I talk about a biblical faith vs. a counterfeit or pseudo-faith or what I call a capitalistic westernized faith, what we tend to do is send our missionaries, send our ministries out, disciple certain people and put these weights and things upon man and say, “Unless you produce in this manner, then you’re not fruitful and you’re not worthy of my time.” John the Baptist in his life would not even be mentioned if we were writing this from a westernized perspective. He would have been considered unfruitful. The Lord convicted me of this in my life. To share you a personal illustration, the Lord has allowed me to have a ministry called “Red Revolution.” “Red” being the color and “Revolution,” being the movement, how we should transform society. Really it’s a call to push us past our subcultural preferences and differences and to exalt Jesus Christ past ethnic lines, past cultural lines, past class. It really is to say, “You know what? We can be a disciple maker in any context and any culture because Jesus Christ supersedes all.” And it’s with that vision that Life Way approached us and said, “Hey, do you want to put out a Bible study?” Long story short, the Bible study comes out in the Fall of 2008. The Lord wrecks my heart in 2009 of wanting to fight against various epidemics of sex trafficking and sweat shops and children soldiers. He just wrecks my heart on that. So in 2010, I asked Life Way, “Hey can you turn Red Rev officially into a non-profit?” And they responded with this, “Adam, on the front end of this, we approached you and put a lot of money into this study. We projected this study to be one of the better studies, if not the most successful study out of our fifteen studies in this division. Not only is your study not doing as well as we thought, it’s doing the worst out of all the studies and it doesn’t make sense to put more money into it.” So instead of focusing on that they were saying, it sent me into this spiral of saying, “Well Lord, I thought that You called me to do this?” I felt like I wasted my time, I wasted the money I spent and I wasted their money. Going into this thing, if I’m honest, I felt like the Lord called me to this and I would always say, “No, it’s about the Lord. It’s about His kingdom.” But deep within my heart, I had the westernized idea that this has to materialize in my lifetime to show that I’m valued in the eyes of man, to show that I have this type of faith instead of a kingdom minded faith. If I’m being honest, I was thinking that this study, once it hit the eyes of man, would splinter into all of society. Just like Louie Giglio has his Passion conference, I was starting to desire conferences and I would be the black Louie Giglio. So what the Lord was showing me was, “Adam, you entered this thing about your kingdom. You’re saying that it’s about faith,and that you took a faith step, but really the assurance of the things that you hoped for and the conviction of the things unseen was about a manifestation that allowed you to build your kingdom and not a manifestation to point people to the ultimate kingdom, that being the kingdom of Jesus Christ.” He was saying, “You need to repent of that mindset.” That had affected the way I had led, it affected the way I prayed, it affected the people whom I discipled. Because after talking to a businessman, I realized this is my mindset and I believe it’s all of our mindsets if we were honest. This successful businessman who loved the Lord said, “I give an investment three years, five if I’m gracious. If after three years I don’t see anything, we shut it down and say it’s not worth it.” I find that strikingly odd, because how often do we treat the ministry like that? How often do we treat people we disciple like that? How often do we treat our prayers like that? How often do we treat evangelism like that? How often do we say, “We’ve been doing this about three to five years and it’s not returning fruit in the way we see it in America, so therefore it’s not fruitful.” The first thing you need to understand in this text when it says, “Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life,” the first point even in this text is saying, “Even if God has called you to reap, it’s a reaping that shows up in the kingdom.” So it’s an eternal reaping. It’s an eternal gathering of wages. Hebrews 11 kind of builds up this idea of the true faith that we should have. When you look at Hebrews 11:1-13, you will see that “faith is the assurance  of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.” It talks about the people of old, of the Old Testament who were commended by that type of faith. Then it goes on to say that the world was created with this faith. Then it marks off these characters. It talks about Abel, how Abel gave his sacrifice by faith and the Lord received it. It talks about how Enoch walked with God and how by faith he was taken up and did not taste death. It talks about how Noah built the ark and by faith he lead his family through it. It talks about how by faith Abraham and Sarah believed God for a promise. And then it’s very strikingly odd in verse 13. It says, “These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar.” So if you’re looking exegetically at this in light of what Christ is saying that “I’ve called you to reap what you have not labored for,” the question is: Then what truly is faith? What was the promise that was afar? The promise was Genesis 3:15, the first gospel, that says, “One will come from your womb, Eve, to crush the serpent’s head.” And we see a whole Old Testament of hundreds and hundreds of years, we see saints riddled throughout the Old Testament who say, “The Lord has called me to sow in faith, and I can see a hundred generations ahead of time. And if it gives me no benefit, I am pointing to return in the manifestation of Jesus Christ, not myself. So the first point when we look at faith is faith has nothing to do with the material manifestation in your benefit. It has everything to do with the kingdom of God. So if you go back through Hebrews 11, when Abel got killed by his brother, he wasn’t saying, “Man God, I thought this was going to materialize into me being the number one person for sacrifice.” He was saying, “You know what? I gave my sacrifice not to just be commended by God but to show that I’m eagerly awaiting for Jesus Christ to come, to point people toward Jesus Christ.” Abraham and Sarah weren’t allowing their longings and affections to terminate on their son. They were using their son to say, “We believe in this Yahweh and He is going to send His Son eventually in Jesus Christ born in a manger, living a perfect life, becoming guilty for the guilty, dying and raising to the newness of life.” All of them, their lives went to a sowing and pointing towards Jesus. But that takes faith, and that’s something that you can’t see. But we’re about the seeing. So what happens when you make faith westernized, you turn the ministry into a business and we become professionals instead of prophets. We become money managers instead of ministers. John Piper says it like this, “We pastors are being killed by the professionalizing of the pastoral ministry. The mentality of the professional is not the mentality of the prophet. It is not the mentality of the slave of Christ. Professionalism has nothing to do with the essence and heart of the Christian ministry. The more professional we long to be, the more more spiritual death we will leave in our wake. For there is no professional childlikeness, there is no professional tenderheartedness, there is no professional panting after God.” You can cross-reference this paragraph with Matthew 6 where it says, “Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.” The language is very strange here because it’s showing that this can happen even without you knowing it. It’s very deadly in that regard. Then he gives a list of things we can do. We can pray to be seen by men, we can give to be seen by men, we can fast to be seen by men. And if you’re confused, He just says, “Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.” Why do I say that? When we make ministry about, “What is the return? Why am I investing in the here and now?,” ministry then becomes about the bottom line. And what is the bottom line when it comes to a businessman? Numbers. And you may say, “Well, I see numbers in the book of Numbers. I see numbers in Chronicles. I see number in Acts.” Well let me help you with that exegetically. Let’s take Acts for instance. It says that three thousand were added to their numbers daily. Luke was the one who wrote that. I always think within the Baptist subculture, “What if Luke could have been a Baptist at heart. And he heard that message and thought, ‘Man, six thousand men came to know the Lord.’ But the Holy Spirit inspired him to say, ‘No, three thousand men came to know the Lord.’” And if you’re looking at the passage, you need to understand that it was not Peter who reported that number. Peter got up and presented the message of God, and he didn’t leave the stage and go, “You know what, Luke? You need to write down three thousand  came to know the Lord. So when the Bible gets written, make sure you put down three thousand in there.” When we look at Chronicles and look at the life of David, sure we see all those numbers there, and that’s really for the reader. It wasn’t for the person within the story, it wasn’t for the leaders to tell other leaders. We look at David when he took the census, the reason he took the census is for him to rest in that number, it was for him to show his glory in numbers to other kings, and God says, “That’s going to cost you some people. So what do you want? Do you want a famine? Do you want to fall into the hands of the Lord? Do you want to be chased by your enemies?” And that’s when he said, “I’d rather fall into the hands of God than the Hands of man.” But when we make numbers the bottom line, it becomes a business and affects the way we pray, who we disciple, who we lead and how we lead. So let’s go back to John 4. I want to emphasize the words “eternal” and “rejoicing together” in verse 36. Those two phrases are very key. First, faith is a forward-thinking type of understanding. You see generations ahead. That “eternal” and “rejoice together” are continuous, they’re a lifestyle, they are ongoing, they do not stop. By way of illustration, I’ll tell you a story out of my life. When I went to Greece in 2004, I had the privilege of sharing with a guy named Uba George. He came up to me, he was from Nigeria, and he said, “Yo man, I’ve got these CD’s. I got Tupac, I got Biggie. Which one do you want?” Those are rappers by the way. So I could tell just by the cover that they’re bootlegs. So we get into this conversation and the Lord allowed me to navigate sharing the gospel with him. The way I believe that you share the gospel is that you leave it to where the person to say, like the eunuch in Acts, “What prevents me from believing in Christ now?” Don’t force him and go, “So do you want to believe?” So it came to that point and he says, “Well, why can’t I trust in Christ right now?” I’m thinking, “Okay, this is how it goes down.” Now you have to understand, before Uba George, I’ve shared with many people. There are times where I’ve shared and I feel like I’m giving my big joker, my little joker, my ace, my king and I’m just throwing everything at them. I’m like, “They’ve got to get saved on that one, Lord.” Then it comes out, they say, “Thanks for sharing” and they keep on moving. But this time with Uba George, the Lord allows me to lead him to the Lord. So if I had a record, I’m probably one for who knows, but the number is big. But the reason I share that is because sure I could get caught up, get arrogant and begin to think that the Lord used me to lead him to the Lord. Or I could say, “I’m just one that gets to see him come, but there were scores way before me that poured into this man’s life.” And as He says to the disciples, “Hey, this is about an eternal thing. There’s going to be eternal rejoicing.” So this is not the be all to end all. But then He goes on to say, “You are entering something that you did nothing for.” So Uba George calls his mom at the moment back in Nigeria, and she’s hollering on the phone. He puts me on the phone, and she just says, “You know what? I’ve been sharing Christ with this boy since he’s been little.” And just in that moment, I felt just an appreciation just to be a part. But what we do is emphasize the reaper, the person that leads people to the Lord and not the person who sowed. The problem with that is then you have to discount the whole Old Testament and you would have to write out John the Baptist. In our westernized world, those are the people we’re inviting to conferences, if we’re honest. Sowers don’t get press. If you went to a conference and heard them say, “You know what? I’ve been sowing seeds all over the continent of Africa,” the first question is, “Well how many people have you seen come to know the Lord? Show me the numbers.” And if we can’t physically see the numbers, we say, “Well that guy is unfruitful and not worthy to be listened to.” And God is saying, “That is not faith at all. That is a pseudo-faith, not a faith that exalts the Lord.” Before I go, I want to give you some definitions. Faith biblically is trusting in the Lord to bring about an unseen yet sure manifestation in your life with the purpose of pointing people to Jesus as we eagerly await His return. So I pray for the healing, I pray for the position, I pray for the ministry, I pray for the pastor, I pray for the church, but it’s for the purpose of pointing people to Jesus so the world can see that I’m eagerly awaiting the Lord that my affections and longings and devotions do not terminate on this thing, but it terminates on the kingdom of God. So the first point is faith sees generationally ahead. The second point is faith is concerned with the kingdom of God, not the kingdom of man. A pseudo faith or counterfeit faith that looks very similar to a biblical faith is trusting in the Lord to bring about an  unseen yet assured manifestation in our lives and it stops there. It has nothing to do with Jesus, it has nothing to do with those who will come after me and it has nothing to do with this kingdom. And He says, “That is a pseudo, counterfeit type of faith. So as we get back to the verse, one sows and another reaps. And He’s saying that in the context of what? The sower and the reaper rejoice together. Did Uba’s mom and I rejoice for a moment? Yes we did. But He’s saying the true rejoicing comes in heaven. The true celebration comes in heaven. One of the ministries that I think is key is a ministry like Compassion, because it will test your faith. It tests your faith to see if you have a biblical or westernized faith. Why do I say that? My wife and I have a Compassion child by God’s grace. His name is Shimileze. I have a different way of thinking things, and the Lord has to constantly bring me back to the truth. So with a Compassion child, you interact with them, you write letters, you send pictures and sometimes you will get a letter that says, “Hey, I don’t speak good English” and it’s a broken letter. But sometimes you get letters to where you’re like, “Is there a scholar over there writing this letter? Did this kid get a PhD?” But the reality is very few people will ever get to see their child in person. Most of you will have a Compassion child through faith, through sowing. Because the reality is that the gospel will go out in Shimileze’s life but there is not guarantee that I will see the benefit of it. What I do is I sow in faith. I sow in those letters, I sow through money, I sow to where twenty or thirty years later, someone might come and share the gospel with him, I might not even still be alive, but he’ll be able to say, “Because of a family back in Texas, I remember this gospel through the letters that they told me about.” But it takes faith. The person who can see generationally ahead, who is concerned about the kingdom of the Lord has a supernatural lens that supersedes the circumstances in which man tries to box them with. One sows and another reaps. I love this because He says the sower and the reaper may rejoice together. Sometimes we separate the sower and the reaper in our society. In reality, if we went to a conference the person who we say has grown whatever from this to that, there should be a long line of people behind him saying, “You know what? This person helped me sow this.” What has happened is we have compartmentalized ministry and have said, “This person is good at this because of their gifting, and this other person is good at that because of their gifting.” And the Lord is saying that you cannot separate the two. It is a marriage. They are one. So it is my belief that the Lord has taught many of us in this room to be sowers, to give our lives to sowing the gospel in faith. It’s as Paul said. He planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth. You cannot drum up reaping, you cannot drum up somebody’s salvation. The Lord brings the reaping unbeknownst to the person. The person does not seek after reaping. It takes faith to sow, and it takes faith to say, “I’m going to launch out and give my life to this without any concern of man.” There are some ways I think you can cultivate faith. If you go back through Hebrews 11, you see Abel who gave up his best. What are you doing to show that you are giving your best? Because giving your best shows trust that the kingdom is more worthy of God than the kingdom of man. In that sense, he gave his fruit, that would be his finances. Can you cultivate faith in giving beyond this generation financially to something you may not see? That’s how you cultivate faith. With Noah, he built an ark. So in the literal sense, he looked like a fool. He was building an ark in a landlocked place. He wasn’t even by the sea. And it took him years and years. He invested money of that day, time of that day. And people were looking at him like, “You are a fool!” What in your life are you cultivating that people would look at and go, “You look like a fool,” but you believe God has put in on your heart because it may not manifest itself in your generation but the generation to come? That’s how you cultivate faith. What are you praying for in a supernatural or medical sense cultivating faith through your prayers? In a medical sense, Abraham was 75 years old and Sarah was 60 and her womb was dilapidated. So medially they shouldn’t have had children. And I’m sure they had been telling people, “The Lord is going to bless us with a child.” It could be a child, it could be healing, it could be anything, but what are you medically, who are you medically praying for where it does not make sense and you will be ridiculed by men but in faith you are praying biblically in faith? If you look at Moses, it says that he gave up his ethnicity. And I know there’s a little tension here in the South, but I’m going to talk about it. What are you cultivating in relationships? Where are you going past  your ethnic comfort, your class comfort, your social comfort, your economic comforts to say, “In faith, I’m sowing into this economy, this ethnicity, this subculture because I don’t just want to point people who look like me towards Jesus Christ, but I want to point everybody to Jesus Christ”? It says Moses did that in faith. If you look at that story in Exodus, that was tough. He was raised in the Egyptian culture. So that was his natural subculture, even though he was a natural Hebrew. In faith he left that, not because he wanted to lead the people out of bondage, but because he said, “You know what? One is coming that’s going to be born in a manger. He’s going to live, He’s going to die, He’s going to raise again and He’s going to reconcile all things to Him.” What in faith are you cultivating in that way? Faith biblically looks generationally ahead. Faith is heavenly rewarding. It’s focused on the kingdom of God. Faith has a narrow perspective, and that perspective is the kingdom of the Lord. As I close, I want to read another quote by John Piper, and then I want to tell you a story. John Piper says, “Brothers, we are not professional. We are outcasts. We are aliens and exiles in the world. Our citizenship is in Heaven, and we wait with eager expectation for the Lord (Phil. 3:20). You cannot professionalize the love for His appearing without killing it. And it is being killed. The world sets an agenda for the professional man; God sets the agenda for the spiritual man. The strong wine of Jesus Christ explodes the wineskins of professionalism.” May we move away from this westernized faith to a biblical faith. May we be bold enough to not allow circumstances and the thoughts of man dictate the bestowed power that a disciple of Christ is called to. And may we jump even if we can’t see our feet land. One last story before we pray. The story of the first martyr in North Korea goes like this. He felt like the Lord called him to gather up some Bibles and pass them out in North Korea. I can just imagine him going to his friends and saying, “Hey, I know that the resources are scarce, but please give to me. I know that the Lord has called me to this.” He was gathering up these Bibles, because at this time, it was a dime a dozen. This was a thing that was hard to get. So he gets these Bibles and goes out with his first wave probably thinking that this is going to be the first of many. And on the first wave, he is killed, martyred. Because the resources were so scarce at the time, those who martyred him took the pages from the Bibles and used them to line their walls as wallpaper. The story continues on that those same people who martyred him started to read their wall. And lo and behold, those people came to know the Lord and the gospel explodes in North Korea. But he just was obedient and had faith that the Lord was calling him to sow. He didn’t know that he would die, he didn’t even know that it would cause an outpouring in North Korea the way that it did, but he knew that the Lord called him to sow. I pray that we be men and women who sow, that we sow boldly, that we sow free from the constraints of man and that we jump and live our inherent power in this generation. Let me pray. “Lord, it is not by accident that You have brought us here today, and I thank You for that. Lord, I thank You for how You convicted me and still convict me of this in my own life. Lord, I pray that You call many at this moment to repentance, but even if you don’t, this is a seed worth sowing. Someone here needed to hear this message today. So Lord, I pray that if anyone doesn’t even know Christ that the first seed that needs to be sown is the gospel and that they can know of the unconditional love of Jesus Christ and how He took the weight of sin upon Himself. He became sin so that we could become the righteousness of God. Lord, I thank You for that. Lord, I pray right now that this seed is planted on fertile soil to produce fruit, not a fruit that man can see but a fruit that will remain until Jesus returns. Lord Jesus, come soon. It’s in His name we pray. Amen.”"
20,organic-faith,0,"My name is Barry Keldie. I’m the lead pastor at Providence Church in Frisco. We were planted from the Village about four years ago, and every once and a while I get to come home and spend some time with you guys. Matt is not here obviously. He will be back. I’m on vacation from my church, so this is what preachers do on their vacations. So here I am. I spent some time on staff here so my wife and I know some of you. And when you come into this type of setting where you know people but you haven’t seen them in a long time, you get the same question over and over and over again. You walk up and say, “How are you?” or “How are things going?” And there are some physical cues you can take. Like if they have bags under their eyes and 62 lbs of baby stuff, you know they’ve had a baby. So it’s, “Congratulations. Can I babysit for you?” You know how to kind of engage, but other than that, we’re asking questions to figure out, “What has changed since the last time I saw you? How are you different?” Most of the time, we’re speaking of a job change, a life change, a major thing that we can talk about, some ways that I can continue keep up with your life. It’s more of an update. But that is a loaded question. How are you doing? How are things different with you now from the last time I’ve seen you? This is one of the most dominant questions in the New Testament. How are you doing? How are you different? How have you grown since the last time I’ve seen you? It doesn’t get asked in those words per se. You don’t read it like that, but that’s what’s going on. When the apostle Paul writes the churches, what he’s saying is, “How have you changed? How much deeper is your walk with God? How much more victory have you seen over sin? How much more well rounded is your leadership in your home, of your kids? How are you doing?” Peter says it explicitly like this in 1 Peter 2. Peter is, of course, the patriarch of the church. He is one of the forefathers. He says it like this, “So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander. Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation— if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.” He compares our spiritual life, the trajectory of walking with God for a long time, to being an infant and growing up. Now that’s a pretty easy picture for us to see. I mean, we can look around and see that a baby is different than an adult in certain ways. So how am I spiritually growing up? Is there substantive change in my spiritual maturity? There are things that a baby can do that adults cannot, right? In my office, I have a picture of my two-year-old in a shark costume for Halloween, and he is pitching a fit. He is screaming, crying and it is adorable. We took pictures, we framed the pictures and we put them in my office. Because when kids do it, it’s adorable. Well this week I had a similar instance with a seventy-six year old great-grandmother pitching an absolute fit. Now she wasn’t wearing a shark costume, or I would have taken a picture. That would have been adorable. But she wasn’t. She was just screaming and hitting herself. It was not adorable. I did not take a picture. It was sad. Because she’s not an infant, right? When my two-year-old gets upset, he’s decided the way to handle it (because pitching a fit obviously didn’t work) by taking all of his clothes off. “I’m mad. I’m stripping naked.” The other day he was just taking his pants off and I was like, “What are you doing, buddy?” And he said, “I am frustrated.” So while that may work for him, you can’t do it. You can’t be standing in the check-out line at Kroger and go, “This is taking too long. You should not be looking at coupons. I’m taking my clothes off.” You’ll go to jail. How many parents in here have picked up your children to smell their bottom? Don’t lie. Before you had kids, you judged people who did this. You can’t do that to a grown-up. If it’s a teenager, you’re going to jail. If it’s a grown-up, you’re not going to have any friends. Babies are different. You can do things with babies and babies can do things and they’re okay because they’re babies. Babies get away with things. That’s why people judge you when you take your baby into a movie. Because we know they’re going to throw things and cry. They’re babies. That’s why if you take your kids on to an airplane, everyone looks at you like you have leprosy. Because they know babies are different. And we absolutely say babies are adorable. It’s funny when they do all of these things. But if they do them for twenty more years, thirty more years, it’s not funny anymore, is it? It’s not cute anymore. You go, “We need to figure out what’s wrong and what’s broken. Well throughout the Scriptures, the dominant theme is “Grow up.” We have to grow up. Our faith is such that it grows. There is no such thing as a faith that doesn’t grow. It doesn’t exist. Our faith is absolutely organic. It’s fluid. You have to mature. You have to stop spiritually doing infantile things. Now the good news is the reason we put up with things that babies do is because we know that one day they won’t do them anymore. I agree to change my kid’s diapers because I know I won’t have to do it forever. If I did, I don’t know that I would have gotten into this game. So you have this idea that this is temporary. So it’s okay. “You can pitch a fit. It’s okay that you can’t spell. It’s okay that you don’t want to eat your dinner. It’s okay that you want to watch Little Einstein over and over again. It won’t last forever.” And so infancy is okay. The Scriptures say the same things about us. Jesus looks upon our infancy as Christians and says, “You are justified. Be encouraged, child. I have paid for your sins. When you fall, when you stumble, when you don’t know, when you mess up, I have absolutely paid the price. Be encouraged.” And He does so with such authority because He knows that if He has redeemed you, if you have tasted that He is good as Peter says, you will grow. Paul says it like this in Philippians 1:6, “And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ” So God says, “I started it. I made you an infant. I will grow you up. It will happen.” So you don’t have to be shamed for being an infant. You don’t have to be shamed for not knowing, for struggling, for striving, for craving. God does not condemn infancy, but He does warn us against stagnation. It is okay to be young; it is not okay to be stagnant. And the overwhelming majority of the modern church is just above infancy and just below maturity. That’s where you find yourself sitting in a church, especially in a church like this one, and you hear these wonderful things about life with God and you hear about joy and fullness and vibrancy and victory and life and you go, “I want that. Well if you are stagnant, if you’re just mature enough to be a baby, if you know just enough to stay away childish things spiritually but you’re not willing to take the next level of maturity on, you’re going to find yourself increasingly frustrated. Because you’re going to hear things that you hear from this stage and you’re going to say, “Not me. Why do I not have those things? Why do I not feel that way?” So my goal with you this morning is just to help stir in you enough to move forward. I don’t care about pace and how quickly you move. Every child learns things at different paces. They walk at different times, they crawl at different times and they learn to spell at different times. I know every parent in here quietly competes, every dad especially. Pacing is not the issue, movement is. So my hope is that we could look at the nature of spiritual maturity, discipleship, spiritual formation (whatever you want to call it) and that you and I would realize how essential this is. Discipleship is not a program. Being discipled, being a mentor, growing in our faith is no something super Christians do. It’s something every Christian does. It’s not optional. If a kid doesn’t grow, we go, “Something is wrong.” It’s the same thing spiritually. So what does Peter tell us? He says a couple of things, and I want to talk a little bit about the nature of growth here. The first thing we see that might help, he puts it like this, “Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk,...” In some of your translations, it’s going to say, “crave pure spiritual milk,...” It is this idea that we would struggle, that we would strive, that we would pursue, that we would chase, that we would do something to grow. He says, “You’ve got to understand, spiritually there is a discipline component that is put on you to grow.” On the other side of that verse, he says, “...that by it you may grow up into salvation.” So there is also a salvation, a grace, a mercy component to your growth. So we find that our spiritual maturity is this symphony of grace and works, of mercy and discipline. Some things you have to strive for. With painstaking repetition, you work at it, you crave it, you struggle and little by little you mature. Some things God speaks into your heart in a moment and changes you. Our maturity is a symphony of both of those things, not one or the other. Our kids grow like this. There are some things with your kids that you have to teach them over and over and over again. “Don’t hit your sister...don’t hit your sister...don’t hit your sister...” And you show flash cards and pictures and it is  painstaking repetition. And some things they just get. Will came home the other day and knew John 3:16. He quoted it to me. “Daddy, do you know that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son...” He quoted the whole thing to me. And I said to my wife, “Babe, good job. Way to teach the kids some Scripture.” And she said, “I didn’t do it. I don’t know where he heard that.” I was like, “Well, you probably should have taken credit for that one, but we’ll just tell people it was me.” But apparently he just overheard it. He learned his ABC’s the same way. He walks in one day singing the ABC’s. “Hey buddy, where did you hear that?” Well, we were in Target walking past a toy with a “try me” button, it sings the ABC’s, he heard it and now he knows it. Some things are instant, miraculous, and some things take discipline. And we as Christians tend to camp out on one extreme or the other. We tend to be those people who are all grace. “When are you going to stop looking at porn?” “When God changes my heart. When He takes away the desire.” Really? Jesus said cut your arm off or pluck our your eye. Really? You’re just going to claim grace? Some of us camp out all with discipline. There is no supernatural change or dependence on the spirit. It’s “I will do better...I will do better...I will do better...you should do better...we should all do better...” It’s all accountability, it’s all discipline, it’s all work. We have to realize it’s a symphony of both. There are moments of supernatural change. We hope for them, we sing for them and we beg for them. And then we also, with painstaking repetition, work and we take those things out of our life. Paul uses the picture of being an athlete, of shedding everything that would hinder you. So there’s grace, and there’s discipline. There’s both. So hopefully you’re going, “While God will not judge my infancy, He will judge my stagnation. I need to make sure I am begging God for miraculous change and having regular, righteous disciplines. I am reading the Scriptures, I am in accountability, I am in a group. I am doing those things.” Our spiritual growth, our development is different than every other kind of growth in a very unique way. When we raise children, we raise them to self-reliance. We hope they are stronger than we are, we hope they can fend for themselves, we hope they need us less and less. That is what good parenting is. So when we read in the Scriptures that we are like infants and we need to grow up to our salvation, we need to as Hebrews 6:1 says, “leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity.” So we have this language that we’re like children turning into adults over and over and over again. Well, if our spiritual life is like our physical life, then we’re going to have a great, great problem. Because our spiritual growth is not into self-reliance, is it? We don’t want to grow spiritually into independence. We want to grow spiritually into dependence on God. A couple of years ago, Charity and I were in Colorado. I was doing a camp, and I got to take the whole family. Charity decided that we wanted to hike. So she bought this thing where you can strap a baby to yourself and do almost anything. You can play football, basketball, juggle, it doesn’t matter, the baby hangs right there. I strap Will to me and we hike up the mountain. All along the way, Will is grabbing and eating leaves and chewing on sticks. We put him down to take a picture next to the river. He starts eating rocks. He’s a baby. Not only that, but he’s a baby boy. So you put those two things together and he’s going to eat whatever he can put his hands on. When we get back down, Charity makes this statement. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could come back in twenty years when the kids are old and we could do it again? We could say, ‘Do you see this picture? You were just a baby. And we sat in front of that very waterfall. Do you see that dead tree? It’s dead because you ate it when you were a baby.’” Now imagine if my two-year- old son was twenty years bigger, but I still had to strap him to my chest and he’s eating leaves and chewing on rocks. I probably wouldn’t want to go on that vacation. I would probably skip that one...or at least make Charity carry him. It wouldn’t be good. Because we want our kids to be self-reliant. He needs to be able to hike the hill himself at a certain age. We tend to think of our spiritual walk in the same kind of way. In the beginning, as spiritual infants, God straps us to Him and hikes life. He handles it, He carries us. But He’s not going to do it forever. God doesn’t want to have to carry you for ever. One day you’re going to have to grow up and be self-reliant. Well, the Scriptures paint the opposite picture. Look at the apostle Paul. This is a great illustration because we have Paul’s whole life. The apostle Paul was Saul, he killed  Christians, he was a very bad person, Jesus saved him personally, Jesus comes down from heaven, saves Saul and turns him into the apostle Paul. Now within the Scriptures, that allows us to see Paul as an infant Christian all the way to the mature man who wrote most of the New Testament. So we can watch his pattern of growth, and this is what we see. Flip over to 1 Corinthians 15:9. This is a very early writing by Paul. He probably writes this in 54A.D. Very early in his ministry, he describes himself like this, “For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.” The apostles were an elite group of people who had seen Jesus physically. So he goes, “Of this small group of leadership, I’m the least.” If you flip over to Ephesians 3:8, it’s about six years later, around 60A.D. He’s a bit more mature, he’s learned more, he’s seen more and we see him describe himself again. So we get to see what growth and maturity looks like. He says this, “To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.” So six years later, he’s more mature and has moved from the least of the apostles (a very small group) to the least of all the Christians (a large group). If you look at 1 Timothy 1:15, we find ourselves about eight years later, around 68A.D. He’s a bit more mature, a bit more down the road and here’s how he describes himself. “The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.” He’s at the end of his career, he’s going to die. As a mature, older man, Paul is writing to a young man, handing off his ministry. And as the pinnacle of maturity, Paul describes himself as the worst of all the sinners. So he moves from the worst of the apostles to the worst of the Christians to the worst person in the world. So his arc of maturity doesn’t lead to self-reliance; it leads to a better understanding of his reliance on God. So our spiritual maturity doesn’t mean that we begin to repent less; it means we repent more. It doesn’t mean we confess less; it means we begin to confess more. We are more aware of our sin the more mature we get. So answer me this. Why in the world would discipleship, accountability, group be more important for infant believers than mature believers? Why is it that so many so-called mature believers have the least amount of accountability, the least amount of support, the least level of confession and repentance. Is it because we think we don’t need it? Because according to Paul, we need it more. Heaven isn’t a place for people who no longer need God. He’s not working on you to get you to the point where you’re reliant enough to go and live in heaven and not bother anybody. Heaven is a place for those who are fully enthralled with Him, those who love that they’re dependent on Him. That’s our maturity. The last thing I’ll tell you about growth is this. It’s sustained or sparked by what Peter says in 1 Peter 2:3, by tasting and seeing that the Lord is good. When we talk about maturation or growing up, we tend to think about the fruit of our lives. We tend to think of what we’re doing. “I should do more Bible studies...I should know more...” We tend to think of all of these things that are apparent and invisible. Peter says, “You will grow like an infant into an adult if you tasted and saw that the Lord is good.” So you may be going, “How do I move past this moment of being stagnant or spiritually dry? How do I get out of it? What do I do?” Well, it happens by tasting the Lord. Now tasting is a very strange word for us. Because spiritually our faith isn’t very tactile. We don’t see God, we don’t taste God, we don’t smell God, we’re not around God. Everything is spiritual. So to put a sensual phrase like taste next to God almost makes this unrealistic for us. But here’s what we have to realize. The pictures that we use in helping analogize our faith are most of the time based on humans and people. We need to stop being babies, we need to grow up. It’s mostly centered around us. Well in the 1st century, their culture was completely different. Our culture is people-centered. What’s the most important commodity in the West? People. It’s not machines, it’s not agriculture, it’s people. We are a people-driven economy. So that’s how we talk. But in the 1st century, they were not a people-driven economy. They were an agricultural, field kind of people. They were just moving into these cities, but even in the cities, agriculture was the economy. So most of the pictures you read about in the New Testament have to do with planting and growing plants. So it’s better for us to understand this phrase in those terms than in human terms. So instead of you thinking, “I’m going to taste the Lord physically as a person,” you’ve got to see how Jesus and Paul uses these phrases. You’ve got to see your life as a plant, as a tree. There’s basically three parts: there’s roots, there’s a stalk or trunk and then there’s fruit. If you wanted  to water a Peach Tree, you can spray water at the peaches all day. But it’s not going to do any good. The water hitting the fruit does nothing. The water running down the trunk does nothing. The water is not going to do anything until it seeps into the roots. That’s where the Lord is tasted, the root. So rather than dealing with fruit in your life (what you do), you need to deal with roots (why you do it). Don’t just say, “I need to stop looking at porn.” That’s good. You do need to stop, but you need to ask the question, “Why am I looking at porn?” We can’t just make blanket statements like, “I need to improve my marriage.” You have to ask the root question, “Why is my marriage broken?” You can’t just deal with the fruit; you have to deal with the root. Every action has a belief under it. Jesus says the root of our faith is the heart. We find that starting in Deuteronomy 6, all the way into the Ten Commandments, all the way into Jesus’ teachings, all the way through the Epistles. It says Jesus changes the heart, and the heart will change the actions. Ezekiel 36 says it like this, “I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh...and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.” So here’s what I want to show you quickly. In 1 John, this idea is tackled. In 1 John, John is an old man, kind of a grandpa, writing to a young church. He keeps calling them “little children.” And in chapter 2, verse 3, he addresses this issue. He says, “And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments.” In other words, if I know God, I’m going to grow and mature. I’m going to obey Him. He goes on to say this, “Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we may know that we are in him: whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.” He basically says, “If you know God, you will grow to be more like Him.” If you say you know God and are not growing to be more like Him, John says you are a liar. So then the question is: What does it mean to know Him, to taste Him? We find that answer one page over in 1 John 4:16. He says this, “So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us.” He’s saying this, “We have come to two things: to know and to believe the love that God has for us.” Our growth, tasting the Lord, moving forward comes from knowing the love that God has for you and believing the love that God has for you. The better word than “believe” in our context is trusting. When he says “believe,” he doesn’t mean cognitively; he means “I trust.” That’s more the biblical phraseology. He says, “I know the love that God has for me, and I trust it.” Most of the time, a child doesn’t quite understand why you’re telling him to do what you’re telling him to do. Will doesn’t understand why we make him eat vegetables. “Daddy, you are being so mean to me. I can’t believe that you would make me eat okra. It’s slimy.” I get it. At the end of the day, his obedience is going to be either, “I trust that my daddy loves me and knows more than I do” or “I don’t.” If he trusts that his daddy loves him and knows more than him, he’ll obey. If he doesn’t, he won’t. As we mature, we know more, therefore we trust more. How many adults have you apologized to as you turned into one? How many times, since you had kids, have you told your mom or dad, “I’m sorry?” Because now we know. He’s saying, “You have to taste the Lord. You have to know and trust the love that He has for you. That is maturity. That is pressing on.” So the question I’ll close you with is simple. How are you doing? How are you different than last time I saw you? Let me pray for you, then we’ll close. “God, we are so thankful for Your grace. We’re so thankful for Your love for us in that You are so patient with us. Our prayer as we go through our day, as we continue on, is that we would be able to correctly assess where we are. And if we’re stagnant or apathetic, we pray that You would give us the grace to move forward, that You would miraculously give us the motivation, the hunger, the craving to do the things we need to do. So God, in this moment we ask You to move please. In Christ’s name we pray. Amen.”"
